# Is not having kids selfish? Some women in countries with the world's lowest fertility rates think otherwise
**Aoife Yi** <br/>
26-year-old high school teacher, Didn't want her to have own kids and have no plan for kids in the foreseeable future <br/>
Reason: 
-Seeing her parents <br/>
Grew up in a single-parent family in China and saw what her mum went without to be a parent. Thought her mum would have a more relaxing life without her <br/>
-What women loses from birth <br/>
prices" women may pay to become a mother in China — not just financial, but also opportunity costs <br/>
-"I'm afraid that I won't have enough of my own time and will lose my individuality."  <br/>

## Having kids to 'rely on them'
**Ms Yi** <br/>
Worries about the demands and burden of being a parent <br/>
-Opposing thoughts <br/>
Parents: Must have a child so I can rely on them when I'm getting old <br/>
=> She doesn’t care what happens when she gets old as long as she lived a happy life."  <br/>
-Becoming a mother should be a "gift", but it feels more like a "shackle and burden" for her at the moment <br/>
**Chitra Panjabi** <br/>
Was a teenager when she knew children would not be in her future <br/>
-Born and raised in a traditional community in Hong Kong, a region with one of the lowest fertility rates in the world <br/>
-Ms Panjabi's husband initally wanted children, but she says her stance on not having them never wavered <br/>
Couple have now been married for 13 years <br/>
-"I imagined having a partner in the future, a career and life that would be fulfilling — and kids didn’t factor into it at all." <br/>
-There was expectation that she would become a wife and mum and expressed disconnect or lack of alignment with this expectation <br/>
-Believes as women have more opportunities, they start to see the true costs of parenting <br/>
See the reality of what it means to be a parent especially without additional caregivers/nannies, and how much it costs. Therefore, more reluctance seem to grow towards birth and raising kids. <br/>

## Asia grapples with falling fertility rates
The lowest fertility rates in the world are in East Asian countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and, recently China <br/>
-South Korea Birth rate <br/>
Back in February, South Korea continued its decline, once again recording the world's lowest rates <br/>
South Korea, which now has a fertility rate of 0.78, is the only Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member with a birthrate below 1 <br/>
-Japan Birth rate <br/>
Number of babies born in Japan fell for an eighth-straight year to a fresh record low <br/>
It was the lowest number of births since Japan started compiling the statistics in 1899 <br/>
-India and China Birth rate <br/>
Experiencing declines, with fertility rates dropping to 2 and 1.09 in 2022 respectively <br/>

## Why aren't people having kids?
**Professor McDonald** <br/>
Declining fertility rates are the result of a combination of factors related to the employment of women <br/>
-Work <br/>
"Employers in these countries demand loyalty to the company above all else — including family," <br/>
"This leads to very long work hours that make it near impossible to combine work with child rearing." <br/>
-Don't have much help at home <br/>
Young men are required to work "even longer hours" <br/>
"Their employment vulnerability is also high, meaning that household work in couple families falls very heavily upon the wife,"  <br/>
-Employer discrimination <br/>
As for the women who do have children, Professor McDonald says they are often faced with employer discrimination – even those who are considering having children <br/>
"The losses to potential earnings for women for having children are very considerable. In the face of these societal arrangements, women opt to have no children, even not to marry." <br/>
-Housing and loans <br/>
Ahead of elections in April, South Korea's major political parties vowed more public housing and easier loans to encourage childbirth, aiming to allay fears of "national extinction" as fertility rates crumble <br/>
After spending more than 360 trillion won ($270 billion) in areas such as childcare subsidies since 2006, the parties' focus on population growth has failed to reverse record low fertility rates <br/>

**Ms Yi** <br/>
“Society, especially in China, assumes that women are the ones responsible of taking care of children” <br/>

### Not just women in Asia wanting to be child free
-Deciding to have children <br/>
More women are weighing up the sacrifices, whether it is career goals or maybe their mental health, that they'll have to make when it comes to deciding whether to have children <br/>
-India  <br/>
So much of traditional norms are highly gender specific and that can make people feel boxed in," Ms Panjabi says <br/>
-"I see a pretty incredible shift in feminist ideas in India, and I think more women are asking themselves if kids are what they really want. That is refreshing and powerful!" <br/>

### Australia's cost-of-living crisis driving similar choices
Australia's total fertility rate — representing the number of children a woman would have if she lived through her childbearing years — was 1.63 births per woman in 2022 <br/> 
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics also revealed the average age of mothers has been increasing <br/> 
In 2022, women aged 30-34 years had the highest fertility rate at 114.9 babies per 1,000 women, higher than 108.6 babies in 2001 <br/>
