# Object Detection Synthetic Data Generation
omni.replicator.object is a no-code-change-required extension that generates synthetic data for model training, that can be used on a range of tasks from retail object detection to robotics <br/>
It takes a description file in YAML that describes a mutable scene, or a hierarchy of such stacked description files as input, and outputs a description file along with graphics content including RGB, 2D/3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, etc <br/>
