# Object Detection Synthetic Data Generation
omni.replicator.object is a no-code-change-required extension that generates synthetic data for model training, that can be used on a range of tasks from retail object detection to robotics <br/>
It takes a description file in YAML that describes a mutable scene, or a hierarchy of such stacked description files as input, and outputs a description file along with graphics content including RGB, 2D/3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, etc <br/>

## Run Instructions
The extension can be run from the UI, or isaac-sim container <br/>
### Run from the UI
In Omniverse Kit or Isaac Sim, enable omni.replicator.object from Windows -> Extensions -> THIRD PARTY <br/>
A window will pop up <br/>

Clicking on the folder icon or the Visual Studio Code icon below, <br/>

The root folder of the extension will be open <br/>

Under source/extensions/omni.replicator.object/omni/replicator/object/configs there are many description files in YAML format <br/>

Itâ€™s recommended to start with demo_kaleidoscope.yaml <br/>
To do so, go to global.yaml and update output_path to any local folder to store the simulation output <br/>

Next, put demo_kaleidoscope in the Description File textbox, and hit Simulate to start simulation; <br/>
alternatively, you can also put the absolute path .../source/extensions/omni.replicator.object/omni/replicator/object/configs/demo_kaleidoscope.yaml, with ... being the local path <br/>
Results will be stored in output_path <br/>

Errors in loading the environment, so I applied the simple_room.usd instead <br/>
