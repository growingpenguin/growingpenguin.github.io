# Ordinary criminal procedure in the United States 

**Overview**<br/>
Criminal Procedures <br/>
Deals with the set of rules governing the series of proceedings through which the government enforces substantive criminal laws <br/>
Municipalites, States, and Federal governments each have their own criminal codes, defining types of conduct that constitute crimes <br/>
Title 18 of the US code outlines all federal crimes. <br/>
Typically federal crimes deal with activities that either extend beyond the state boundaries or directly impact federal interests <br/>
<br/> 
**Federal** <br/>
:Federal prosecutions follow the Federal rule of Criminal Procedure <br/>
-This criminal procedure is proclaimed by the Supreme Court and passed by the Congress <br/>
-Federal Rules incorporate and expound upon all guarantees included within the US Constitution of Bill of Rights <br/>
-ex. Guarantee to due process and equal protection, right to legal counsel, right to confront witnesses, right to a jury trial, right to not testify against oneself <br/>
**State** <br/>
:State prosecutions follow the Criminal Procedure Code of individual states <br/>
-Many states choose to mimic the federal rules <br/>
-State Procedure rules may offer greater protection to the defendant in the criminal trial than the U.S. Constitution or Federal Rules, but may not offer less protection than guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution <br/>
<br/>
**Investigatory and Accusatory Police Procedure** <br/>
: The U.S. Constitution, the Federal Rules, and the state and local rules, and the court's representation of the document not only sets out how the trials are run, but also prescribe the procedure that the law enforcement agencies must follow. <br/>
-Should an officer fail to abide by the proper procedure, the trial court may suppress the evidence obtained in violation of the proper procedure, which could even result to the criminal's acquittal <br/>
-Law enforcement agencies are limited in their abilities well before the arrest <br/>
-ex. Portion of the criminal procedure deals with the officer's ability to stop the individuals, search them or their property, and seizing any incriminating evidence the officer finds. <br/>
