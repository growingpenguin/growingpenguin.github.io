# Ordinary criminal procedure in the United States 

**Overview**<br/>
Criminal Procedures <br/>
Deals with the set of rules governing the series of proceedings through which the government enforces substantive criminal laws <br/>
Municipalites, States, and Federal governments each have their own criminal codes, defining types of conduct that constitute crimes <br/>
Title 18 of the US code outlines all federal crimes. <br/>
Typically federal crimes deal with activities that either extend beyond the state boundaries or directly impact federal interests <br/>
<br/> 
**Federal** <br/>
:Federal prosecutions follow the Federal rule of Criminal Procedure <br/>
-This criminal procedure is proclaimed by the Supreme Court and passed by the Congress <br/>
-Federal Rules incorporate and expound upon all guarantees included within the US Constitution of Bill of Rights <br/>
-ex. Guarantee to due process and equal protection, right to legal counsel, right to confront witnesses, right to a jury trial, right to not testify against oneself <br/>
**State** <br/>
:State prosecutions follow the Criminal Procedure Code of individual states <br/>
-Many states choose to mimic the federal rules <br/>
-State Procedure rules may offer greater protection to the defendant in the criminal trial than the U.S. Constitution or Federal Rules, but may not offer less protection than guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution <br/>
<br/>
**Investigatory and Accusatory Police Procedure** <br/>
: The U.S. Constitution, the Federal Rules, and the state and local rules, and the court's representation of the document not only sets out how the trials are run, but also prescribe the procedure that the law enforcement agencies must follow. <br/>
-Should an officer fail to abide by the proper procedure, the trial court may suppress the evidence obtained in violation of the proper procedure, which could even result to the criminal's acquittal <br/>
-Law enforcement agencies are limited in their abilities well before the arrest <br/>
-ex. Portion of the criminal procedure deals with the officer's ability to stop the individuals, search them or their property, and seizing any incriminating evidence the officer finds. <br/>
**Fourth Amendment** <br/>
Protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures <br/>
-ex. Mapp v. Ohio <br/>
Evidence acquired from unreasonable searches and seizures is inadmissable in criminal trial <br/>
-Search Warrants are needed <br/>
To avoid illegally searching or seizing the property of a suspect, law enforcement personnel typically obtain search warrants <br/>
To obtain search warrants, they should show reasonable cause, support by showing oath or affirmation, must describe particularly the place they will search and the items they will seize <br/>
-Also specifies what constitutes a reasonable interrogation <br/>
-ex. Miranda v. Arizona <br/>
The police must make defendants aware of their rights prior to the defendant making any statements, provided the government intends to use those statements prior to the defendant making any statements, provided the government intends to use those statements as evidence against the defendant. The Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment require law enforcement to ensure that defendant understand the right to remain silent and their right to have an attorney present during the interrogation <br/>
-Fourteenth Amendment applies all forementioned substantive due process rights to state criminal defendants <br/>
<br/>
## Pre-trial Procedure
**Voir Dire** <br/>
The Sixth Amendment also guarantees the right to a public trial by an impartial jury of one's peers. One manner in which the criminal justice system attempts to provide for an impartial jury is by permitting both sides to use **peremptory challenges** during jury selection. If a party exercises a peremptory challenge against a prospective juror, then the court must excuse that juror from the panel. These challenges occur during jury voir dire, and are meant to root out bias. While neither the prosecution nor the defendant needs to explain their reasons for a challenge, not every challenge is permissible. As the Supreme Court explained in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), and J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994), a party cannot remove a juror solely for the juror’s race or gender.<br/>
**Right to a Speedy Trial** <br/>
The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to a speedy trial. Consequently, prosecutors cannot wait an inordinate amount of time before filing charges or proceeding with the prosecution after filing charges. Under the Speedy Trial Act, which Congress passed to clarify the speedy trial guarantee, a trial must begin within 70 days of the prosecutor filing the indictment.<br/>
**Gurantee of a Fair Trial** <br/>
The Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process requires that criminal defendants receive a fair trial. In high-publicity trials, trial judges have the responsibility to minimize effects of the publicity on jurors’ decisions, such as through implementing a **gag-order** on the parties. In Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70 (2006), the Supreme Court held that a jury was not unduly influenced by the family of the victim wearing buttons with the picture of the victim on them. <br/>
**Other Miscellaneous Guarantees** <br/>
Due process further commands that defendants have the right to call their own witnesses, mount their own evidence, and present their own theories of the facts. The prosecution must turn over all evidence that will be presented against the defendant and allow the defendant pre-trial access to question the prosecutor's witnesses to properly mount a defense.<br/>
Pre-trial would also be the point at which the defense might raise a defense of double jeopardy, if such a defense existed in that case. 
-The Fifth Amendment, through the Double Jeopardy Clause, prohibits states from charging the same defendant with substantially the same crime on the same facts. <br/>
