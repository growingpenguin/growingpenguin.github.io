Issues, rights, and health concerning the ability to reproduce and the freedom to make decisions about one's own reproductive processes <br/>
Everything related to the ability to have children and making choices about that process <br/>

**groundbreaking** <br/>
Something that was very new and innovative at the time it was introduced, doing things no one else had done beforegroundbreaking  <br/>

**advocating** <br/>
Supporting or promoting something passionately <br/>
**articulate** <br/>

The term highlights her unwavering dedication to exposing injustices, advocating for women's rights, and making significant efforts to bring about social change <br/>
**founded** <br/>
Established or created <br/>
Gloria Steinem, along with Brenda Feigen and Dorothy Pitman-Hughes, established or created the Women's Action Alliance in 1971 <br/>
It implies that they took the initiative to start this organization as a way to address and fight against sexism <br/>
**empower** <br/>
To give someone the power or confidence to do something <br/>
In the case of the Women's Action Alliance, the goal was to empower women <br/>
Meaning the organization aimed to give women the tools, confidence, and support they needed to stand up against sexism and make positive changes in society for themselves and others <br/>
**publications** <br/>
Newspapers, magazines, and possibly online media outlets where articles, stories, and information are printed or published for the public to read <br/>
When it mentions "publications women wrote for," it's talking about the places where women journalists and writers could have their work published <br/>
The issue Gloria Steinem observed was that these outlets did not accurately or sufficiently represent the real-life experiences of women, including herself <br/>
**barriers** <br/>
Obstacles or challenges that prevent progress <br/>
Obstacles or challenges that make it difficult for women to achieve equality or succeed in various aspects of life, including in their careers, personal development, or social status <br/>
These barriers could be discriminatory practices, cultural norms, or institutional policies that disadvantage women <br/>
**harassment** <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation, often in a sexual manner, but also in forms of bullying or unwelcome behavior that women face in their day-to-day lives, especially in the workplace or in public spaces. This harassment is part of the sexism that women deal with regularly <br/>
**sexism** <br/>
Discrimination based on a person's sex, usually manifesting as prejudice against women and resulting in unequal treatment or attitudes <br/>
**contended with** <br/>
To struggle against, face, or deal with challenges or difficulties <br/>
So, when it's said that women "contended with sexism, barriers, and harassment on a daily basis," it means they were regularly facing and trying to overcome these issues <br/>
**feel that** <br/>
Personal belief or perception <br/>
The personal belief or perception of these women writers and editors regarding their work and the environment they were in <br/>
It indicates that these individuals did not believe or perceive that the magazines they were working for reflected their own interests or allowed them to share and be truthful about their personal experiences <br/>
**glossy** <br/>
shiny, high-quality <br/>
The physical appearance of the magazines, which have a shiny, high-quality finish on their pages. This term also implies that the content might be more focused on surface-level issues or aesthetics, typical of many fashion and lifestyle magazines <br/>
**nominally** <br/>
Name only <br/>
While these publications were targeted at women, the depth of content that truly reflected women's diverse interests and concerns was lacking <br/>
The use of "nominally" implies a discrepancy between the magazines' intended audience and the actual relevance or significance of their content to that audience's lives <br/>
**parenting advice** <br/>
Guidance and tips related to raising children <br/>
This content was typical of women's magazines at the time, focusing on how to be a good parent, child care, and other related topics, reflecting societal expectations of women's roles primarily as caregivers <br/>
**addressing** <br/>
Discussing, tackling, or dealing with certain topics or issues <br/>
In this context, Steinem felt that these magazines were not addressing the real and significant struggles that women faced in a society where men held most of the power and influence <br/>
Instead, the magazines focused on traditional roles and interests assigned to women, without challenging the status quo or exploring deeper issues of equality, rights, and women's liberation <br/>
**getting out** <br/>
Distributing or making something available to a broader audience <br/>
It refers to Steinem's intention to spread or publish the type of writing and content that she and her colleagues valued, which focused on women's issues, rights, and stories that mainstream publications were not covering <br/>
**newsletter** <br/>
A type of publication, usually consisting of a simple, concise format, that is regularly distributed to a specific audience to provide information on particular topics or interests <br/>
Newsletters are often used by organizations and groups to communicate updates, news, and other relevant content to their members or supporters <br/>
**outrageous** <br/>
Extraordinary, bold, and perhaps unconventional in someone's actions, thoughts, or style <br/>
In this context, "outrageous" describes Florynce Kennedy in a positive and admiring way <br/>
It suggests that Kennedy was extraordinary, bold, and perhaps unconventional in her actions, thoughts, or style <br/>
The term indicates that Kennedy had a strong and impactful presence, likely challenging norms and standing out due to her remarkable personality or groundbreaking actions <br/>
By calling Kennedy an "outrageous woman," the speaker highlights her distinctive and influential character, which made her a memorable and inspiring figure in the movement for women's rights and social justice.
