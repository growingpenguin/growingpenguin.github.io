**groundbreaking** <br/>
Something that was very new and innovative at the time it was introduced, doing things no one else had done beforegroundbreaking  <br/>
Gloria Steinem called the feminist magazine Ms. "groundbreaking" because it was the first magazine that was owned, operated, and written by women <br/>
**advocating** <br/>
Supporting or promoting something passionately <br/>
**articulate** <br/>

It suggests that Gloria Steinem was able to communicate her views on feminism, social justice, and other issues in a way that people could easily understand and resonate with <br/>
**committed** <br/>

The term highlights her unwavering dedication to exposing injustices, advocating for women's rights, and making significant efforts to bring about social change <br/>
**founded** <br/>
Established or created <br/>
Gloria Steinem, along with Brenda Feigen and Dorothy Pitman-Hughes, established or created the Women's Action Alliance in 1971 <br/>
It implies that they took the initiative to start this organization as a way to address and fight against sexism <br/>
**empower** <br/>
To give someone the power or confidence to do something <br/>
In the case of the Women's Action Alliance, the goal was to empower women <br/>
Meaning the organization aimed to give women the tools, confidence, and support they needed to stand up against sexism and make positive changes in society for themselves and others <br/>
**publications** <br/>
Newspapers, magazines, and possibly online media outlets where articles, stories, and information are printed or published for the public to read <br/>
When it mentions "publications women wrote for," it's talking about the places where women journalists and writers could have their work published <br/>
The issue Gloria Steinem observed was that these outlets did not accurately or sufficiently represent the real-life experiences of women, including herself <br/>
**barriers** <br/>

Obstacles or challenges that make it difficult for women to achieve equality or succeed in various aspects of life, including in their careers, personal development, or social status <br/>
These barriers could be discriminatory practices, cultural norms, or institutional policies that disadvantage women <br/>
**harassment** <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation, often in a sexual manner, but also in forms of bullying or unwelcome behavior that women face in their day-to-day lives, especially in the workplace or in public spaces. This harassment is part of the sexism that women deal with regularly <br/>
**sexism** <br/>
Discrimination based on a person's sex, usually manifesting as prejudice against women and resulting in unequal treatment or attitudes <br/>
**contended with** <br/>
To struggle against, face, or deal with challenges or difficulties <br/>
So, when it's said that women "contended with sexism, barriers, and harassment on a daily basis," it means they were regularly facing and trying to overcome these issues <br/>
**feel that** <br/>

The personal belief or perception of these women writers and editors regarding their work and the environment they were in <br/>
It indicates that these individuals did not believe or perceive that the magazines they were working for reflected their own interests or allowed them to share and be truthful about their personal experiences <br/>
