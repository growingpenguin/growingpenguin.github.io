**groundbreaking** <br/>

**founded** <br/>

It implies that they took the initiative to start this organization as a way to address and fight against sexism <br/>
**empower** <br/>
To give someone the power or confidence to do something <br/>
In the case of the Women's Action Alliance, the goal was to empower women <br/>
Meaning the organization aimed to give women the tools, confidence, and support they needed to stand up against sexism and make positive changes in society for themselves and others <br/>
**publications** <br/>
Newspapers, magazines, and possibly online media outlets where articles, stories, and information are printed or published for the public to read <br/>
When it mentions "publications women wrote for," it's talking about the places where women journalists and writers could have their work published <br/>
The issue Gloria Steinem observed was that these outlets did not accurately or sufficiently represent the real-life experiences of women, including herself <br/>
**barriers** <br/>
Obstacles or challenges that prevent progress <br/>
Obstacles or challenges that make it difficult for women to achieve equality or succeed in various aspects of life, including in their careers, personal development, or social status <br/>
These barriers could be discriminatory practices, cultural norms, or institutional policies that disadvantage women <br/>
**harassment** <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation <br/>
Aggressive pressure or intimidation, often in a sexual manner, but also in forms of bullying or unwelcome behavior that women face in their day-to-day lives, especially in the workplace or in public spaces. This harassment is part of the sexism that women deal with regularly <br/>
**sexism** <br/>
Discrimination based on a person's sex, usually manifesting as prejudice against women and resulting in unequal treatment or attitudes <br/>
**contended with** <br/>
To struggle against, face, or deal with challenges or difficulties <br/>
So, when it's said that women "contended with sexism, barriers, and harassment on a daily basis," it means they were regularly facing and trying to overcome these issues <br/>
**feel that** <br/>
Personal belief or perception <br/>

**glossy** <br/>
shiny, high-quality <br/>

**nominally** <br/>
Name only <br/>
While these publications were targeted at women, the depth of content that truly reflected women's diverse interests and concerns was lacking <br/>
The use of "nominally" implies a discrepancy between the magazines' intended audience and the actual relevance or significance of their content to that audience's lives <br/>
**parenting advice** <br/>
Guidance and tips related to raising children <br/>
This content was typical of women's magazines at the time, focusing on how to be a good parent, child care, and other related topics, reflecting societal expectations of women's roles primarily as caregivers <br/>
**addressing** <br/>
Discussing, tackling, or dealing with certain topics or issues <br/>
In this context, Steinem felt that these magazines were not addressing the real and significant struggles that women faced in a society where men held most of the power and influence <br/>
Instead, the magazines focused on traditional roles and interests assigned to women, without challenging the status quo or exploring deeper issues of equality, rights, and women's liberation <br/>
**getting out** <br/>
Distributing or making something available to a broader audience <br/>
It refers to Steinem's intention to spread or publish the type of writing and content that she and her colleagues valued, which focused on women's issues, rights, and stories that mainstream publications were not covering <br/>
**newsletter** <br/>
A type of publication, usually consisting of a simple, concise format, that is regularly distributed to a specific audience to provide information on particular topics or interests <br/>

**outrageous** <br/>
Extraordinary, bold, and perhaps unconventional in someone's actions, thoughts, or style <br/>
In this context, "outrageous" describes Florynce Kennedy in a positive and admiring way <br/>
It suggests that Kennedy was extraordinary, bold, and perhaps unconventional in her actions, thoughts, or style <br/>
The term indicates that Kennedy had a strong and impactful presence, likely challenging norms and standing out due to her remarkable personality or groundbreaking actions <br/>
By calling Kennedy an "outrageous woman," the speaker highlights her distinctive and influential character, which made her a memorable and inspiring figure in the movement for women's rights and social justice.
**In tribute to** <br/>
To honor or show respect for someone's memory or achievements <br/>
When the founders considered the name "Sojourner" for their magazine, it was meant as a way to honor Sojourner Truth, acknowledging her significant contributions and legacy <br/>
Naming the magazine after her would have been a way to keep her memory and the values she stood for alive in the magazine's mission <br/>
**Abolitionist** <br/>
A person who advocated for the abolition <br/>
In the context, a person who advocated for the abolition (or the end) of slavery <br/>
In the case of Sojourner Truth, she was an African-American woman who escaped from slavery and became a prominent activist not only for the abolition of slavery but also for women's rights. Her work involved speaking out against slavery and fighting for equality, making her a significant figure in both movements <br/>

**surfeit** <br/>
An excessive amount or overabundance of something <br/>
In this case, it describes the overwhelming number of chores or tasks that the goddess Kali is depicted as managing simultaneously <br/>

**moment of truth** <br/>
A critical or pivotal time when a person realizes or recognizes the truth about a situation, leading to a significant shift in their perspective or understanding <br/>
Jane O'Reilly's article "Click: The Housewife's Moment of Truth" discusses the profound realization or epiphany that women experience upon recognizing the biases and inequalities present in society against them <br/>
