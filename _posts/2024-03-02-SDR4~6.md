# USRP Environmental Setup 4~6

## Introduction
-Basic End-to-End Simulation: <br/>
Important to go beyond basic simulations and gain experience in actual implementation <br/>
Utilization of Real Hardware Devices: <br/>
Implementations using real hardware devices are necessary <br/>
-Starting with Everyday Use Cases: <br/>
Start with things commonly used in daily life, such as AM/FM radios <br/>
Focus on FM Radio with Optional Addition of AM: <br/>
Prioritize FM radio and consider adding AM as needed <br/>
-One of the Necessary Functions for Receiving such Radios is Filter <br/>
Learning and discussing concepts related to filters is essential <br/>
Learning and Implementing Filters: <br/>
From simple filters to matched filters, learning and implementing various types of filters are necessary for receiving radios effectively <br/>

## Modulation 
Process: <br/> 
Impose an input signal on to a carrier wave <br/>
Change some property, such as amplitude, or frequency <br/> 
(1)Input signal(Base Signal) <br/>
-Data signal wave we want to transmit <br/>
-Height varies according to the loudness of our voice <br/>
(2)Carrier Wave <br/>
-Pure wave of contant frequency <br/>
-Very much like a sine wave <br/>
-By itself, it doesn't carry much information of what we can relate to <br/>
-Needed to deliver our data signal <br/>
-Frequency of the carrier wave is generally higher than data signal wave <br/>
Why do we need modulation during a transmission? <br/> 
Purpose <br/>
It is like throwing a paper far away and if we wrap a rock with it, we are able to throw it farther away <br/>
Data signal wave is like the piece of paper and a rock is the carrier wave <br/>
Modulation is the process of wrapping the rock with a piece of paper to throw the paper to a direction where we want <br/>
-Data signal wave(Input signal) is a lower frequency wave <br/>
Lower frequency wave is more susceptible to interference than higher frequency wave <br/>
Modulation makes the data signal to a higher frequency wave <br/>
-Higher frequency wave would have a more bandwidth, thus carrying more data <br/>
-Lower frequency signals would require a much larger size antenna at the receiving end <br/>
Modulation reduces the size of the antenna with the increase of wave frequency <br/>
-Security is another reason <br/>
Data signal is hidden inside the carrier wave <br/>

## What is AM?
**AM(Amplitude Modulation)** <br/>
![SDR7-9_4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/a424cd0a-6593-49b3-b503-1644e040f10f) <br/>
Process: Add this input signal to the pure carrier wave <br/>
Result: Carrier's amplitude(height) will change corresponding to the input signal that is fed into it(base signal) <br/>
Example: <br/>
Get radio to play back the signal as actual music or dialog by tuning it to the whatever frequency the station looking for broadcast sets <br/>
Makes the antenna resignate at the freqency and ignore everything else in the air <br/>
**FM(Frequency Modulation)** <br/>
![DR7-9_9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/0c085c91-0553-4f90-b804-b0246f1c5110) <br/>
Process: Add input signal to the pure carrier wave <br/>
Result: The frequency of the carrier wave will be changed <br/>
(1)Input signal(Base Signal) <br/>
-Height varies according to the loudness of our voice <br/>
-The VM station broadcasts a signal at constant frequency <br/>
(2)Carrier Wave <br/>
-Soundwave representing the actual audio <br/>
(3)Modulation Scheme(Analog or Digital) <br/>
Input signal with a carrier wave <br/>
(4)Transformer <br/>
Sits idle as long as exactly whatever frequency you're tuned to hits your antenna <br/>
But once, detects a small change in your frequency, it outputs a voltage, that is then used to recreate the audio signal, which drives the emit a certain sound <br/>
Example:
Tuned 99.5FM in your dial, FM works by using a very small changes in frequency to carry signal <br/>
Tuned to signals just above and below 99.5MGHZ, making transformers send voltage to speakers <br/>
Changes of frequency to carry our speech information <br/>
**AM vs. FM** <br/>
-Although, process makes FM more complicated to engineer than AM, you get a clearer higher quality signal <br/>
-Less acceptable to interference as well, because interference manifests as amplitude spikes and AM will see spikes as sound to produce, and come out of their radios <br/> 
-FM cares more about variations in frequency rather than amplitude, FM can ignore that type of interference <br/>

## AM/FM Radio Configuration
-AM/FM Radio Implementation <br/>
Basic structure of an AM radio <br/>
Antenna: <br/>
Antenna symbol at the very left, which is used for capturing RF signals from the air <br/>
RF Front End: <br/>
A combination of components such as filters and amplifiers that are used to initially process the incoming RF signal <br/>
Main functions are to filter out unwanted frequencies and amplify the desired signal <br/>
Freq Down Conversion(Frequency Downconversion): <br/>
Converts the received RF signal to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) or directly to baseband (the frequency range starting from near 0 Hz up to a higher cut-off frequency) <br/>
Downconversion is achieved using a mixer and a local oscillator <br/>
The purpose of this is to make the signal easier to process and filter at the next stages <br/>
Baseband Filter: <br/>
After downconversion, the signal is passed through a baseband filter <br/>
This filter is designed to remove any remaining undesired frequencies and noise, leaving only the desired signal, which is now at a much lower frequency than the original RF signal <br/>
Envelope Detector: <br/>
Extracts the audio signal from the modulated carrier wave <br/>
For amplitude modulation (AM) signals, this can be as simple as a diode and a capacitor <br/>
The diode rectifies the signal (allowing only one polarity of the signal to pass through), and the capacitor smooths out the variations to extract the modulation, which is the audio signal <br/>

    Audio Output: Finally, the audio signal is output from the envelope detector and can be sent to a speaker or headphones for listening.
