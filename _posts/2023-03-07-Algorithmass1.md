2.Manually determine the pairs of you who have the same birthday. Explain your method of solution<br>
    
3.Develop an algorithm for the first question using pseudo code.<br>
 
4.Create code that calculates the probability of having at least two students with the same birthday in a class of k students. Apply several different ks.<br>

5.Demonstrate that if there are 100 students in a classroom, it is 99.999% probable that there is a pair of students with the same birthday. Conduct computational experiments to solve this problem.<br>
