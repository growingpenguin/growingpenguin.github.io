Algorithm 1주차 과제
  
1.Download the birthday data
2.Manually determine the pairs of you who have the same birthday. Explain your method of solution
    
3.Develop an algorithm for the first question using pseudo code.</h3>
 
4.Create code that calculates the probability of having at least two students with the same birthday in a class of k students. Apply several different ks.

5.Demonstrate that if there are 100 students in a classroom, it is 99.999% probable that there is a pair of students with the same birthday. Conduct computational experiments to solve this problem.
