# Outline 
## Non-personalized system
Doesn't matter who you are! <br/>
Sorts each item in the same way, no matter who you are <br/>
ex.No matter who goes to hacker news, the same thing is shown to the viewer <br/>

## Collaborative Filtering
Takes who you are into account <br/>
Taking to account things I like and find other things that are similar <br/>
Can also use users that are similar to me to make recommendations <br/>
ex. Like Notebook & Titanic love story => Titanic is a good recommendation <br/>
    Like Paranormal activity & Ring => Titanic is a bad recommendation <br/>

## Matrix Factorization 
Matrix factorization(A.K.A SVD) and its variants like probabilistic matrix factorization to take recommendations to next level <br/>

## Deep Learning(DL)
How DL can be applied to recommendation system <br/>
-Easy to convert matrix factorization code into Keras script <br/>
-How we can modify our script to use DNN instead of just matrix factorization <br/>
-Borrow ideas from computer vision, especially residual networks and inception to see if we can improve upon a single neural network <br/>
-How unsupervised DL can be applied to build recommendation systems (**auto-encoders** & restricted Boltzmann machines) <br/>
