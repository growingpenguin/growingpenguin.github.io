# PointCloud Data
## What is PointCloud data?
**Computer Vision** <br/>
Computer Vision: Replicating the human visual system in machine learning, granting them the ability of gaining understanding and reasoning from visual information images and videos <br/>
-Processing done mostly on image or videos <br/>
**3D Computer Vision** <br/>
One branch of computer vision <br/>
Traditional computer vision understands the world by referring to the fact that 3D space information is projected to the 2D image space, and from the visual information, performs an inference to the information needed<br/>
3D Computer vision, on the other hand can use the 3D data acquired through various sensors  <br/>
How to acquire these 3D data? <br/>
(1)Stereo Images <br/>
Using stereo images, can acquire stereo depth <br/>
(2)Multi-view Images <br/>
Can acquire multi-view geometric using multi-view Imagess <br/>
(3)RGB-D camera or Point cloud camera <br/>
Using RGB-D camera or Lidar acquired Point cloud data can be acquired in real-time <br/>
Various 3D data can be acquired directly and processing such data, performs the task of understanding the situation and infer to the information needed <br/>
**Understanding 3D** <br/>
3D data acquired using various sensors or processes can be represented many ways by the computer <br/>
-Parametric (explicit) surface representation <br/>
Direct information about each point on the surface <br/>
The postitions of points, surface attributes(such as normal, colors, etc.) are directly stored <br/> 
=> Point cloud is one of the explicit representation <br/>
-Implicit surface representation <br/>
3D surface, or 3D figure from the sensor is defined in the form of mathematical function representing the surface <br/>
In the function, the value that thresholds (or 'cuts off') is defined as the surface <br/>
-Implicit surfaces can represent more complex surface shapes compared to explicit surfaces and are particularly useful for smoothly changing surfaces <br/>
