# Create Lambda Funtions
## Create two Lambda Functions
(1)Lambda Function name: csv_sloshingprediction1 (Same as the old csv_sloshingprediction) <br/>
This Lambda function is designed to process a CSV file retrieved from the S3 bucket inferencefilecsv1. The file contains data intended for sloshing prediction analysis <br/>
It forwards the necessary parameters to a primary Lambda function tasked with generating predictions, utilizing an AI model specifically trained for high-accuracy sloshing predictions <br/>

I am going to copy and paste the Lambda function which I created from scratch so I will select 새로 작성 <br/>
The name of the function is csv_sloshingprediction1 <br/>
I would set the Python runtime Python3.9, identical to the old lambda function csv_sloshingprediction <br/>

(2)Lambda Function name: sloshing-service-dev-predict-sloshing1 (Same as the old sloshing-service-dev-predict-sloshing) <br/>
This function is responsible for making sloshing predictions using a pre-trained AI model. It operates based on parameters received from the csv_sloshingprediction1 Lambda function <br/>
The deployment of this Lambda function is managed through the Serverless Framework under the csv_sloshingprediction1 configuration <br/>
