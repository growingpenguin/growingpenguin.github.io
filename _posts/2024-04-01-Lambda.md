# Create Lambda Funtions
## Create two Lambda Functions
(1)Lambda Function name: csv_sloshingprediction1 (Same as the old csv_sloshingprediction) <br/>
This Lambda function is designed to process a CSV file retrieved from the S3 bucket inferencefilecsv1. The file contains data intended for sloshing prediction analysis <br/>
It forwards the necessary parameters to a primary Lambda function tasked with generating predictions, utilizing an AI model specifically trained for high-accuracy sloshing predictions <br/>

Click on 함수 생성 <br/>
![S3_25](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/a73b606b-d407-4997-a81d-6293c2a10f10) <br/>
I am going to copy and paste the Lambda function which I created from scratch so I will select 새로 작성 <br/>
The name of the function is csv_sloshingprediction1 <br/>
I would set the Python runtime Python3.9, identical to the old lambda function csv_sloshingprediction <br/>
To use the role I already created in the IAM, I will select 기존 역할 사용 <br/>
And on the bottom select S3ReadEventRole <br/>
Then click on 함수 생성 <br/>
=> Now created S3 bucket and Lambda <br/>
![Lambda1](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fecbf2f5-bb5f-4118-a65e-99034b193281) <br/>
Add a trigger by clicking on + 트리거 추가 <br/>
![Lambda2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/317beb2f-b1a7-4792-8cab-4701f8ceb544) <br/>
Chose the source S3 <Br/>
Choose the bucket inferencefilecsv1, which contains the data intended for sloshing prediction analysis in a csv file format  <br/>
Chose the Event type PUT <br/>
(Lambda will be triggered when we put inside the object) <br/>
Wouldn't want to change anything from prefix or suffix <br/>
Checked on the warnings, stating that different S3 buckets are needed for inputs and outputs <br/>
![Lambda3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/373f88af-b6c7-4ca8-ad31-53bac87ae9a3)
Trigger successfully added to Lambda <br/>
Copy and paste the code from the old lambda function csv_sloshingprediction <br/>
Pressed Deploy, to deploy the Lambda Function <br/>

(2)Lambda Function name: sloshing-service-dev-predict-sloshing1 (Same as the old sloshing-service-dev-predict-sloshing) <br/>
This function is responsible for making sloshing predictions using a pre-trained AI model. It operates based on parameters received from the csv_sloshingprediction1 Lambda function <br/>
The deployment of this Lambda function is managed through the Serverless Framework under the csv_sloshingprediction1 configuration <br/>
