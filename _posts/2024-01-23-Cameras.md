# ROS Tutorials (Linux Only) 
## [Cameras](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/ros_tutorials/tutorial_ros_camera.html) 
**Learning Objectives** <br/>
Example <br/>
Learn how to <br/>
Add additional cameras to the scene and onto the robot <br/>
Add camera publishers <br/>
Send ground truth synthetic perception data through rostopics <br/>

### Camera Publisher
**Setting up Cameras** <br/>
Default camera displayed in the Viewport is the Perspective camera <br/>
(Can verify that by the Camera button on the top left hand corner inside the Viewport display) <br/>
Picture <br/>
Click on the Camera button and you will see there are a few other preset camera positions: Top, Front, and Right side views <br/>
Purpose of this tutorial: <br/>
Letâ€™s add two stationary cameras, naming them Camera_1 and Camera_2 <br/>
Viewing the room from two different perspectives <br/>
-Procedures for adding cameras to the stage can be found in [Add Camera and Sensors](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/gui_tutorials/tutorial_gui_camera_sensors.html#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-gui-camera-sensors) <br/>
Picture <br/>
-May want to open additional Viewports to see multiple camera views at the same time <br/>
To open additional Viewports: <br/>
Window -> Viewport -> Viewport 2 to open the viewport, and select the desired camera view from the Cameras button on the upper left corner in the viewport <br/>

**Building the Graph for a RGB publisher** <br/>
(1)Open Visual Scripting: <br/>

Window > Visual Scripting > Action Graph <br/>
(2)Edit Action Graph <br/>
Picture <br/>
Click on the New Action Graph Icon in middle of the Action Graph Window <br/>
Picture <br/>
Edit Action Graph if you want to append the camera publisher to an existing action graph <br/>
(3)Build an Action Graph with the nodes and connection of the following image, and parameters using the table below <br/>

Action Graph <br/>
Picture <br/>
Parameters: <br/>
| Node                   | Input Field | Value           |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Isaac Create Render Product | cameraPrim  | /World/Camera_1 |
|                        | enabled     | True            |
| ROS1 Camera Helper     | type        | rgb             |
|                        | topicName   | rgb             |
|                        | frameId     | turtle          | <br/>
Ticking this graph will automatically create a new render product assigned to Camera_1 <br/>
**Graph Explained** <br/>
Isaac Create Render Product: <br/> 
Creating a render product prim which acquires the rendered data from the given camera prim and outputs the path to the render product prim <br/>
Rendering can be enabled/disabled on command by checking/unchecking the enabled field <br/>
ROS1 Camera Helper: <br/>
Indicating which type of data to publish, and which ros topic to publish it on <br/>
