How to create game-like elements such as a UI that displays scores and sound effects." <br/>

## Designing Games
Chapter 3 is more like an example than a game <br/>
From Chapter 4, various elements will be added such as UI and sound effects to make it look more like a game <br/>
However, it's hard to learn everything at once <br/>
In Chapter 4, a slightly more complex example than in Chapter 3 will be created, and gradually learn how to display UI and write director objects." <br/>
### Planning the Game
In Chapter 4, a 'Car Stopping Game' is created where the car goes near the flag and stops <br/>
The game screen is as follows: <br/>
When the game starts, a car is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and when the screen is swiped, the car starts running and then gradually slows down and stops <br/>
The length of the swipe can be adjusted to change the driving distance of the car <br/>
A flag is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, and the distance between the car and the flag is shown in the center of the screen <br/>
