# UI and Director Project
Learn how to display the progress or status of the game and create messages <br/>
Chapter 4 is about 'Car Stopping Game' <br/>
How to create game-like elements such as a UI that displays scores and sound effects." <br/>

## Designing Games
Chapter 3 is more like an example than a game <br/>
From Chapter 4, various elements will be added such as UI and sound effects to make it look more like a game <br/>
However, it's hard to learn everything at once <br/>
In Chapter 4, a slightly more complex example than in Chapter 3 will be created, and gradually learn how to display UI and write director objects." <br/>
### Planning the Game
In Chapter 4, a 'Car Stopping Game' is created where the car goes near the flag and stops <br/>
The game screen is as follows: <br/>
When the game starts, a car is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and when the screen is swiped, the car starts running and then gradually slows down and stops <br/>
The length of the swipe can be adjusted to change the driving distance of the car <br/>
A flag is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, and the distance between the car and the flag is shown in the center of the screen <br/>
![Metaverse4-1](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/437eb395-21cd-45c7-8b43-22f2ff37817f) <br/>
Thinking About Game Resources <br/>
Let's design the game based on the game screen <br/>
As with Chapter 3, the design goes through five stages <br/>
1st Stage: List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
2nd Stage: Decide on the controller script that can move the objects <br/>
3rd Stage: Decide on the generator script that can automatically create objects <br/>
4th Stage: Prepare the director script that can update the UI <br/>
5th Stage: Think about the flow of creating scripts. <br/>
Stage 1: List All Objects to Be Placed on the Screen <br/>
List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
Looking at the game screen in Figure 4-1, think about what objects are needed <br/>
For now, the 'car' and 'flag', though not conspicuous, the 'ground', and the 'UI displaying the distance' are visible." <br/>
![Metaverse4-2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fda22499-aa28-4a36-ba5e-159fb16e973d) <br/>

Stage 2: Determine the Controller Script That Can Move Objects <br/>
From the objects listed in Stage 1, identify those that move <br/>
The car moves, so it is a moving object, while the flag and the ground are stationary, so they are not moving objects <br/>
The UI that displays the distance between the car and the flag changes its display content, but not its display position, so it is also not a moving object <br/>
![Metaverse4-3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5ce97e6f-7888-490f-87c4-096fc4561088) <br/>
Moving objects require a script (controller script) to control their movement. <br/>
Therefore, in this game, a 'Car Controller' is needed as the script to control the movement of the car <br/>
Required controller script: Car Controller <br/>
Stage 3: Determine the Generator Script That Can Automatically Create Objects <br/>
Find objects that will be created during gameplay <br/>
In the Car Stopping Game, there are no objects that will be created during play <br/>
Stage 4: Prepare the Director Script to Update the UI <br/>
In a play, the director understands the progress of the play and gives instructions to the actors <br/>
Similarly, in a game, a director script is necessary to smoothly continue the play <br/>
In this game, since the distance between the car and the flag needs to be displayed on the UI, a director script must be written <br/>
Required director script: <br/>
A director capable of updating the UI <br/>
![Metaverse4-4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/c2bc26ba-c55e-4978-a6c8-40b9eda6e940) <br/>
Stage 5: Think About the Flow of Creating Scripts <br/>
Consider how to progress the game based on each script <br/>
Basically, the flow is Controller Script -> Generator Script -> Director Script <br/>
![Metaverse4-5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/7bf8c0de-50a5-4b17-844d-69e6e198fd4b) <br/>
"In Chapter 4, the scripts to be created are 'Car Controller' and 'Game Scene Director' <br/>
With just these two scripts, movement can be expressed in the 'Car Stopping Game'." <br/>
Car Controller <br/>
Swipe to start running, then gradually decelerate to a stop <br/>
Also, make the running distance change according to the length of the swipe <br/>
Director Capable of Updating UI <br/>
Finds out the coordinates of the 'car' and 'flag' and displays the distance between them on the UI <br/>
The roulette and car created in Chapter 3 may look different but the creation order is the same <br/>
The method of creating a moving object is always the same, so practice and remember the flow! <br/>
The game being created now also uses a UI along with moving objects <br/>
The order of writing UI is always the same as for moving objects, so be sure to remember it <br/>
The game creation flow can be summarized as follows: <br/>
![Metaverse4-6](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/a4ae93d3-2558-4fad-a08a-1ce9d4fa3c99) <br/>


## Creating a Project and Scene
### Creating a Project
First, create a project <br/>
Click on New Project from the screen displayed when running Unity Hub <br/>
Select the template as 2D, and enter the project name as SwipeCar <br/>
Clicking on Create Project at the bottom right creates the project in the specified folder and runs the Unity Editor <br/>
Template Selection -> 2D <br/>
Project Creation -> SwipeCar" <br/>
![Metaverse4-7](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fb059f8f-b341-44a1-9d94-343b86979dbc) <br/>
![Metaverse4-8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b6ee594e-1e7b-41d2-b27c-7ea9c3802f6a) <br/>
**Adding Resources to the Project** <br/>
Once the Unity Editor is running, add the resources to be used in this game to the project <br/>
Open the chapter4 folder in the downloaded Resource folder and drag & drop all the resources into the Project window <br/>
The roles of the files to be used in the game are as follows <br/>
![Metaverse4-9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/93abb7b3-e3e3-4edd-bc6f-f93b34d9c80a) <br/>

### Setting Up for Smartphones 
We will set it up to be able to build for smartphones <br/>
Select File > Build Settings from the toolbar <br/>
In the Build Settings window, select iOS as the Platform and click on Switch Platform <br/>
![Metaverse4-10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/57468e02-020c-484c-a164-47d07eff57f0) <br/>
Setting Screen Size <br/>
We will set the game screen size <br/>
This time, we will create a wide screen <br/>
Click the Game tab in the Scene view and open the screen size (Free Aspect) list located at the top left of the Game view <br/>
Select a size that matches the target smartphone's screen size (select iPhone 11 Pro 2436 * 1125 Landscape) <br/>

### Saving the Scene
We will create a scene <br/>
Select File > Save As from the toolbar and save the scene name as Game Scene <br/>
A scene icon appears in the Project window of the Unity Editor <br/>
Write Scene > GameScene <br/>
![Metaverse4-12](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b21a1abd-4320-4db3-8074-a7412f464855) <br/>
Placing Objects in the Scene <br/>
Placing the Ground <br/>
We will place the objects needed for the game in the scene <br/>
The objects to be placed here are the ground, car, and flag <br/>
First, place the ground in the scene <br/>
Click the Scene tab, and drag & drop the ground image from the Project window into the Scene view <br/>
The sprite appears in the Scene view and ground is also displayed in the Hierarchy window <br/>
![Metaverse4-14](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/be4d8e4c-ea1a-4afd-9f1e-74d9d7390a5d) <br/>
![Metaverse4-13](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/0b45050a-4b43-4452-ba5b-8409ccdad04e) <br/>
Continue to adjust the position and size of the ground in the Inspector window <br/>
Click on ground in the Hierarchy window, and its details will be displayed in the Inspector window, so specify the coordinates and size for placement <br/>
Set the Position in the Transform section to 0, -5, 0 and Scale to 18, 1, 1 <br/>
The position and size on the screen above the Scene view change according to the settings in the Inspector window <br/>
![Metaverse4-15](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/d1e1988a-44d7-4a9e-92de-154333520692) <br/>
![Metaverse4-16](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/87b7d69c-ffc4-4652-8999-7162aae4868b) <br/>

### Placing the Car
Next, place the car <br/> 
Drag & drop the car image into the Scene view <br/>
The sprite is displayed in the Scene view, and car is also displayed in the Hierarchy window <br/>
![Metaverse4-17](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b57003dd-1400-4e00-8b56-dee499ef2dda) <br/>
Continue to adjust the position of the car in the Inspector window <br/>
Just like with the ground, click on car in the Hierarchy window and specify the coordinates in the Inspector window <br/>
Set the Position in the Transform section to -7, -3.7, 0 <br/>
![Metaverse4-18](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/55da6647-766e-4e37-be3a-a9353dcc5424) <br/>
![Metaverse4-19](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/efcda020-b540-4339-a54b-e16a7800935d) <br/>
### Placing the Flag
Finally, let's place the flag <br/>
Drag & drop the flag image into the Scene view <br/>
The sprite appears in the Scene view, and flag is also displayed in the Hierarchy window <br/>
Click on flag in the Hierarchy window and set the Position in the Transform section to 7.5, -3.5, 0 in the Inspector window <br/>
![Metaverse4-20](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/92c2ef47-73a8-4f18-9177-2c195bee7793) <br/>
![Metaverse4-21](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/109fca28-6788-4353-9f5b-9a20a7d1548e) <br/>
### Changing the Background Color
The background color is blue, which looks too strong, so I will change it to a lighter color <br/>
The background color can be changed in the Inspector window of the Camera object <br/>
Click on Main Camera in the Hierarchy window, <br/>
and then click on the Background color bar in the Camera section of the Inspector window <br/>
When the Color window appears, set the Hexadecimal to DEDBD2. <br/>
![Metaverse4-22](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5788d235-ea7e-4522-848f-862b29c59a41) <br/>
![Metaverse4-23](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/0213cdbb-023c-4b85-b776-3ff6bb1447a2) <br/>
Next, let's move the car <br/>
## Moving the car with a swipe
### Writing the Car Script
Let's move the car <br/>
To move the car, a script (controller script) that describes how to move the car is needed <br/>
Let's write the car script according to the 'method of creating a moving object' and apply it to the car object." <br/>
How to Create a Moving Object <br/>
(1)Place the object in the Scene view <br/>
(2)Write a script that describes how to move the object <br/>
(3)Apply the written script to the object <br/>
Now that we have placed the objects, we will start writing scripts from now on <br/>
![Metaverse4-24](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/39ac3729-1d65-47eb-b18b-ec35db9fb91b) <br/>
At the end, we need to determine the car's moving distance based on the swipe length, but if we start with something difficult, we may not know how to begin and can get flustered <br/>
At this time, we should first write up to the part where the car starts moving and gradually decelerates to a stop when the screen is clicked <br/>
The action of the car running and stopping is structurally similar to the action of the roulette stopping after spinning, which was learned in a previous chapter <br/>
Let's write a script where 'the car runs and then gradually stops when clicked <br/>
Right-click in the Project window, select Create > C# Script to create a script file <br/>
Change the filename to CarController <br/>
Script Writing -> CarController <br/>
![Metaverse4-25](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/6c94be43-dd72-4bd6-b923-06dd5fd8710e) <br/>
In the Project window, double-click on CarController to open the file and enter the script as follows <br/>
```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class CarController : MonoBehaviour
{
  float speed = 0;

  void Start()
  {
    Application.targetFrameRate = 60;
  }

  void Update()
  {
    if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) //마우스를 클릭하면
    {
      this.speed = 0.2f; //처음 속도를 설정한다
    }
    transform.Translate(this.speed, 0, 0); //이동
    this.speed *= 0.98f;  //감속
  }
}
```










**Recap of Metaverse** <br/>
Do not want to deal with high data rate, wnat to deal with a lower data rate and try increase user experience <br/>
