# UI and Director Project
Learn how to display the progress or status of the game and create messages <br/>
Chapter 4 is about 'Car Stopping Game' <br/>
How to create game-like elements such as a UI that displays scores and sound effects." <br/>

## Designing Games
Chapter 3 is more like an example than a game <br/>
From Chapter 4, various elements will be added such as UI and sound effects to make it look more like a game <br/>
However, it's hard to learn everything at once <br/>
In Chapter 4, a slightly more complex example than in Chapter 3 will be created, and gradually learn how to display UI and write director objects." <br/>
### Planning the Game
In Chapter 4, a 'Car Stopping Game' is created where the car goes near the flag and stops <br/>
The game screen is as follows: <br/>
When the game starts, a car is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and when the screen is swiped, the car starts running and then gradually slows down and stops <br/>
The length of the swipe can be adjusted to change the driving distance of the car <br/>
A flag is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, and the distance between the car and the flag is shown in the center of the screen <br/>

Thinking About Game Resources <br/>
Let's design the game based on the game screen <br/>
As with Chapter 3, the design goes through five stages <br/>
1st Stage: List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
2nd Stage: Decide on the controller script that can move the objects <br/>
3rd Stage: Decide on the generator script that can automatically create objects <br/>
4th Stage: Prepare the director script that can update the UI <br/>
5th Stage: Think about the flow of creating scripts. <br/>
