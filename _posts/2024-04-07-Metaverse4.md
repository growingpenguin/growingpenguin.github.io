# UI and Director Project
Learn how to display the progress or status of the game and create messages <br/>
Chapter 4 is about 'Car Stopping Game' <br/>
How to create game-like elements such as a UI that displays scores and sound effects." <br/>

## Designing Games
Chapter 3 is more like an example than a game <br/>
From Chapter 4, various elements will be added such as UI and sound effects to make it look more like a game <br/>
However, it's hard to learn everything at once <br/>
In Chapter 4, a slightly more complex example than in Chapter 3 will be created, and gradually learn how to display UI and write director objects." <br/>
### Planning the Game
In Chapter 4, a 'Car Stopping Game' is created where the car goes near the flag and stops <br/>
The game screen is as follows: <br/>
When the game starts, a car is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and when the screen is swiped, the car starts running and then gradually slows down and stops <br/>
The length of the swipe can be adjusted to change the driving distance of the car <br/>
A flag is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, and the distance between the car and the flag is shown in the center of the screen <br/>

Thinking About Game Resources <br/>
Let's design the game based on the game screen <br/>
As with Chapter 3, the design goes through five stages <br/>
1st Stage: List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
2nd Stage: Decide on the controller script that can move the objects <br/>
3rd Stage: Decide on the generator script that can automatically create objects <br/>
4th Stage: Prepare the director script that can update the UI <br/>
5th Stage: Think about the flow of creating scripts. <br/>
Stage 1: List All Objects to Be Placed on the Screen <br/>
List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
Looking at the game screen in Figure 4-1, think about what objects are needed <br/>
For now, the 'car' and 'flag', though not conspicuous, the 'ground', and the 'UI displaying the distance' are visible." <br/>

Stage 2: Determine the Controller Script That Can Move Objects <br/>
From the objects listed in Stage 1, identify those that move <br/>
The car moves, so it is a moving object, while the flag and the ground are stationary, so they are not moving objects <br/>
The UI that displays the distance between the car and the flag changes its display content, but not its display position, so it is also not a moving object <br/>
![Metaverse4-3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5ce97e6f-7888-490f-87c4-096fc4561088) <br/>
Moving objects require a script (controller script) to control their movement. <br/>
Therefore, in this game, a 'Car Controller' is needed as the script to control the movement of the car <br/>
Required controller script: Car Controller <br/>
Stage 3: Determine the Generator Script That Can Automatically Create Objects <br/>
Find objects that will be created during gameplay <br/>
In the Car Stopping Game, there are no objects that will be created during play <br/>








**Recap of Metaverse** <br/>
Do not want to deal with high data rate, wnat to deal with a lower data rate and try increase user experience <br/>
