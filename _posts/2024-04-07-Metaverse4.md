# UI and Director Project
Learn how to display the progress or status of the game and create messages <br/>
Chapter 4 is about 'Car Stopping Game' <br/>
How to create game-like elements such as a UI that displays scores and sound effects." <br/>

## Designing Games
Chapter 3 is more like an example than a game <br/>
From Chapter 4, various elements will be added such as UI and sound effects to make it look more like a game <br/>
However, it's hard to learn everything at once <br/>
In Chapter 4, a slightly more complex example than in Chapter 3 will be created, and gradually learn how to display UI and write director objects." <br/>
### Planning the Game
In Chapter 4, a 'Car Stopping Game' is created where the car goes near the flag and stops <br/>
The game screen is as follows: <br/>
When the game starts, a car is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and when the screen is swiped, the car starts running and then gradually slows down and stops <br/>
The length of the swipe can be adjusted to change the driving distance of the car <br/>
A flag is displayed at the bottom right of the screen, and the distance between the car and the flag is shown in the center of the screen <br/>
![Metaverse4-1](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/437eb395-21cd-45c7-8b43-22f2ff37817f) <br/>
Thinking About Game Resources <br/>
Let's design the game based on the game screen <br/>
As with Chapter 3, the design goes through five stages <br/>
1st Stage: List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
2nd Stage: Decide on the controller script that can move the objects <br/>
3rd Stage: Decide on the generator script that can automatically create objects <br/>
4th Stage: Prepare the director script that can update the UI <br/>
5th Stage: Think about the flow of creating scripts. <br/>
Stage 1: List All Objects to Be Placed on the Screen <br/>
List all the objects that will be placed on the screen <br/>
Looking at the game screen in Figure 4-1, think about what objects are needed <br/>
For now, the 'car' and 'flag', though not conspicuous, the 'ground', and the 'UI displaying the distance' are visible." <br/>
![Metaverse4-2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fda22499-aa28-4a36-ba5e-159fb16e973d) <br/>

Stage 2: Determine the Controller Script That Can Move Objects <br/>
From the objects listed in Stage 1, identify those that move <br/>
The car moves, so it is a moving object, while the flag and the ground are stationary, so they are not moving objects <br/>
The UI that displays the distance between the car and the flag changes its display content, but not its display position, so it is also not a moving object <br/>
![Metaverse4-3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5ce97e6f-7888-490f-87c4-096fc4561088) <br/>
Moving objects require a script (controller script) to control their movement. <br/>
Therefore, in this game, a 'Car Controller' is needed as the script to control the movement of the car <br/>
Required controller script: Car Controller <br/>
Stage 3: Determine the Generator Script That Can Automatically Create Objects <br/>
Find objects that will be created during gameplay <br/>
In the Car Stopping Game, there are no objects that will be created during play <br/>
Stage 4: Prepare the Director Script to Update the UI <br/>
In a play, the director understands the progress of the play and gives instructions to the actors <br/>
Similarly, in a game, a director script is necessary to smoothly continue the play <br/>
In this game, since the distance between the car and the flag needs to be displayed on the UI, a director script must be written <br/>
Required director script: <br/>
A director capable of updating the UI <br/>

Stage 5: Think About the Flow of Creating Scripts <br/>
Consider how to progress the game based on each script <br/>
Basically, the flow is Controller Script -> Generator Script -> Director Script <br/>
![Metaverse4-5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/7bf8c0de-50a5-4b17-844d-69e6e198fd4b) <br/>
"In Chapter 4, the scripts to be created are 'Car Controller' and 'Game Scene Director' <br/>
With just these two scripts, movement can be expressed in the 'Car Stopping Game'." <br/>
Car Controller <br/>
Swipe to start running, then gradually decelerate to a stop <br/>
Also, make the running distance change according to the length of the swipe <br/>
Director Capable of Updating UI <br/>
Finds out the coordinates of the 'car' and 'flag' and displays the distance between them on the UI <br/>
The roulette and car created in Chapter 3 may look different but the creation order is the same <br/>
The method of creating a moving object is always the same, so practice and remember the flow! <br/>
The game being created now also uses a UI along with moving objects <br/>
The order of writing UI is always the same as for moving objects, so be sure to remember it <br/>
The game creation flow can be summarized as follows: <br/>

## Creating a Project and Scene
### Creating a Project
First, create a project <br/>
Click on New Project from the screen displayed when running Unity Hub <br/>
Select the template as 2D, and enter the project name as SwipeCar <br/>
Clicking on Create Project at the bottom right creates the project in the specified folder and runs the Unity Editor <br/>
Template Selection -> 2D <br/>
Project Creation -> SwipeCar" <br/>

![Metaverse4-8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b6ee594e-1e7b-41d2-b27c-7ea9c3802f6a) <br/>
**Adding Resources to the Project** <br/>
Once the Unity Editor is running, add the resources to be used in this game to the project <br/>
Open the chapter4 folder in the downloaded Resource folder and drag & drop all the resources into the Project window <br/>
The roles of the files to be used in the game are as follows <br/>
![Metaverse4-9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/93abb7b3-e3e3-4edd-bc6f-f93b34d9c80a) <br/>

### Setting Up for Smartphones 
We will set it up to be able to build for smartphones <br/>
Select File > Build Settings from the toolbar <br/>
In the Build Settings window, select iOS as the Platform and click on Switch Platform <br/>
![Metaverse4-10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/57468e02-020c-484c-a164-47d07eff57f0) <br/>
Setting Screen Size <br/>
We will set the game screen size <br/>
This time, we will create a wide screen <br/>
Click the Game tab in the Scene view and open the screen size (Free Aspect) list located at the top left of the Game view <br/>
Select a size that matches the target smartphone's screen size (select iPhone 11 Pro 2436 * 1125 Landscape) <br/>

### Saving the Scene
We will create a scene <br/>
Select File > Save As from the toolbar and save the scene name as Game Scene <br/>
A scene icon appears in the Project window of the Unity Editor <br/>
Write Scene > GameScene <br/>

**Recap of Metaverse** <br/>
Do not want to deal with high data rate, wnat to deal with a lower data rate and try increase user experience <br/>
