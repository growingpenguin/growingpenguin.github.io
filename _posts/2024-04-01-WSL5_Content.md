### How Radio Adapted to Changing Technologies
**1920s: Boom in Radio** <br/>
-Problem: <br/>
Radio waves became so crowded, nearly every radio had poor or sporadic reception <br/>
-Solution: <br/>
The Radio Act of 1927 and the Federal Communications Act of 1934 <br/>
Helped establish some order and guidelines for frequency use and created a policy that stated any broadcaster using the now government-owned airwaves had to act in the public’s interest <br/>
The Radio Act of 1927 and the Federal Communications Act of 1934 <br/>
Laws made to help manage how radio frequencies are used <br/>
Government Ownership of Airwaves: <br/>
Said that the airwaves (the space through which radio signals travel) are owned by the government, which means the government gets to decide how they are used <br/>
Broadcasters Must Serve the Public:  <br/>
Any radio station or broadcaster using the airwaves has to do things that are good for the public <br/>
This could mean providing important news, educational content, or anything else that benefits the community <br/>
**1930s and 1940s: Golden Age of Radios** <br/>  
Radio was the center of most US American families’ living rooms <br/>
Reception became more reliable, programming content became more diverse among others <br/>
Example: News, dramas, comedies, music, and quiz shows <br/>
**1950s** <br/>
-Television began to replace the radio as the central part of home entertainment <br/>
=> Radio was forced to adapt to the changing marketplace (Campbell, Martin, & Fabos, 2007) <br/>
Example: <br/>
1)Radio technology had advanced to the point that it could now be made portable <br/>
Since radio was being forced outside the home, radio capitalized on its portability by marketing pocket-sized transistor radios that could go places television could not <br/> 
2)Radio also partnered with car manufacturers and soon became a standard feature in new automobiles, something that was very uncommon before the 1950s <br/>
3)Radio also turned to the music industry to replace the content it had lost to television <br/>
Stations that once aired prime-time dramas and comedies now aired popular music of the day, as the “Top 40” format that played new songs in a heavy rotation was introduced <br/>
4)Talk radio also began to grow <br/>
Even more recently, radio stations have turned to online streaming and podcasts so their content can still make its way to computers and portable devices such as smartphones <br/>
-Just as radio caught on quickly, however, so did television and movies <br/>
In the end, the combination of audio and visual offered by these new media won out over radio <br/>


## Words
**sporadic** <br/>
Occurring at irregular intervals or only in a few places; scattered or isolated <br/>
So, when referring to "sporadic reception," it implies that the radio signal reception is inconsistent, with the signal strength varying significantly over time <br/>
This can lead to a listening experience where the radio signal comes and goes unpredictably <br/>
**reception** <br/>
The process of catching or receiving the radio waves by a radio receiver, and successfully converting them into audible sound or other forms of data <br/>
Good reception would mean a clear, strong signal with little to no interference, leading to high-quality audio output <br/>
Poor reception, on the other hand, would result in a lot of static noise, weak signal strength, and possibly difficulty in tuning into specific stations <br/>

There was technological improvements: television shows in color <br/>
3 Major television networks: NBC, CSB, and ABC <br/>
Lots of competition among these three tv networks <br/>

Big thing was nightly news (6o'clock and 11 o'clock) <br/>

Cable television , 100s of programs, but network television, still highly rated <br/>
Large cities also have local news <br/>
FCC: Govenmental agencies <br/>
TV, radio was under the public service function law <br/>
They have to provide some information not only <br/>

In depth to a news, unlike Nightly not focusing on one issue and moving to the next <br/>
Extensive interview <br/>
60 minutes <br/>
Investigative, interview controversial issues <br/>

### Cable and Satellite Television
Increased competition, wasn't only the three networks competing anymore <br/>
Try to regulate.. <br/>
Us government changed .. <br/>

HBO subscribe, no channels <br/>
HBO: Grandfather of cable channels, usually showed movies <br/>
Ted Turner <br/>
Launched his own channel <br/>
TBS would mostly show movies <br/>
Turner, developed CNN(Cable NEws Network) <br/>
People intially thought 24 hours was not going to work out, but it did work out <br/>
Now, we have lots of channels, got everything on there <br/>
Cable advantage: Rural areas, didn't have reception, but now we can get channles, no need for antennas <br/>
Network television was free, because airwaves owned for the people <br/>
But for cable, people have to pay for it <br/>
