title:  "Territorial Expansion of the US"
---
# The Louisiana Purchase (1803-1804) 
1763: French And Indian War, all lands east of the Mississipi river was ceded to Britain by France <br/>
1783: American War for Independence, British surrendered => Newly formed America acquired all lands East of the Missipi River <br/>
**1803:** President Thomas Jefferson negotiated a deal for about $15 million with the new ruler of France, Napol√©on Bonaparte <br/>
(Napolen needed money to fund his military campaigns, felt little use of the Louisiana Territory, which had a very few European settlers and no actual administration <br/>
=> Geographic area of the US doubled in size  <br/>
-Upon acquiring the Louisiana Territory, the US claimed the exclusive rights to purchase or forcibly take lands from various American Indian tribal governments who actually owned them. Not all of these interactions and treaties between the US government and the tribal governments were fair- many came from broken treaties, coercion, forced removal of indegenous inhabitants, and threats of violence <br/>
<br/>
# The Expedition of Lewis and Clark(The Corps of Discovery) (1805~1806)
Few Months later of the Louisiana Purchase: Jefferson received approval from the congress to assemble a team of men<br/>
- Who? <br/>
Led by Meriwether Lewis(Personal Secretary) & William Clark(One of Lewis's military commanders) <br/>
Guidance by Sacagawea (Only woman in the group with an infant child, Wife of French fur dealer in the corps of Discovery)<br/>
Helped ease the fear of the Native American people the Corps encountered in their journey <br/>
- Why? <br/>
To search for an uninterrupted water route to the Pacific Ocean <br/>
- How? <br/>
Traveled West of the St.Louis (In present-day Missouri)<br/>
In the NPS(National Park Service), the Lewis and Clark National Historical Trail is administered <br/>
Trail runs west of the St.Louis to the Pacific Ocean along all kinds of terrain(modern highways) through 11 states over approximately 3700 miles(roughly 6000km) <br/>
Recently the National Historic Trail was expanded through 5 more states <br/>
- Result: <br/>
Ultimately learned that was not possible<br/>
However they did discover Mullan Road (An overland route from Upper end of the Missouri River(Present day, Montana) -> Rocky Mountains -> Onward to the Columbia River(Flows through the present-day Orgeon and Washington States to the Pacific) <br/>
Kept detailed journals <br/>
Documents of 120 animals and 182 plants(Many of which were previously unknown to Americans) and Specimans <br/>
Knowledge of nine Native American Languages <br/>
