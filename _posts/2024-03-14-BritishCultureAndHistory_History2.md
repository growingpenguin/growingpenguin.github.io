## The UK of Britain of Ireland
**Paragraph1** <br/>
Forced Ireland to be merged Great Britain <br/>
Scotland benefited from joining UK, but Ireland did not <br/>
How? <br/>
Before 1800s had it own parliment and government <br/>
Not military force <br/>
Irish politions, title and bribed them, then the Irish Parliment voted to join the UK (Corrupt) <br/>
Nationalism in various degrees, some wanted full independence, while most wanted partial independence like having a self government in the UK<br/>
**Paragraph2** <br/>
-Homerule:
Still in UK but can govern ourselves in some extent <br/>
-Issue came out again, not many people were happy about <br/>
-Tried to vote, but lost al the way up to 1914 <br/>
-We can't focus on homerule, because we have to World War1 <br/>
-Resistance organizaton come out, gave independence and take it away<br/>
-Much strict IRB: <br/>
-Easter Risen: Attact British <br/>
Right around the Eastern Holdiay <br/>
German might help, UK being the enemy in the world <br/>
Roger Casement . British found out this plan, was killed for treason(Fight against own country) <br/>
Nationalist was saying we are not part of the UK, why treason <br/>

### EATER RISING:
-Hope everyone join all throughout Ireland <br/>
-Why they not wanted to join? <br/>
Beaten up, It will not happen. Think will end up in a disaster, not want to join <br/>
Landlords, Irish people had to pay for their own land <br/>
-1600 peopele took  <br/>
post office; Main gov building, big building, higher position can shoot people <br/>
Patrick Perse showed up on the steps, read the document (Like declaration of Independence) <br/>

4th paragraph: <br/>
Send bunch of soldiers from England and marshall law <br/>
Inserrection crushed, 450 people killed, 2000 people injured <br/>
At first, I told you, it is a bad situation, now look what you did, we have marshall law <br/>
British government overreacted. <br/>
Arrested 15 leaders, executed them <br/>
Lots of people angry: Did not get their right as a british citizen <br/>
(Trials public, Magna Carta, basic fundamental right, didn't get that, don't have lawyers representing them) <br/>
Used as betrayal.. he was part of ~ <br/>
Kidnapped these people to England without a trial <br/>
Marshal Law, pressure <br/>
Turned Irish people against the government <br/>
East Risen people didn't die in vain, but sparked more interest in nationalism and independence <br/>
Didn't take long for the soldiers to get there <br/>

Election to the British Parliment <br/>
Sinn Fein, Republican army <br/>
Political arm of IRA <br/>
Won full independence of people <br/>
All of them voting for full independence unlike before <br/> 
Sinn Fein, we are not going to London, own parliment, declare independence again <br/>
British army, still in Ireland, start fighting against soldiers <br/>
Advantage: Know where they are, British soldier don't know where they are <br/>
Pretty successful over the guerilla war <br/>

1921, started negotiating, stopped the fighting, signed British parliment <br/>
Ireland not part of the UK, still have some British Influence <br/>
**IMportant** <br/>
Six northern countes remained => Ireland divided <br/>
We want to stay in the UK <br/>
WHy? (Ref) <br/>
Send people to Scotland, and took over (land) Scotland dominant of Political culture) <br/>
Rest of Ireland became free state  <br/>
Completely out of the British Influence <br/>
