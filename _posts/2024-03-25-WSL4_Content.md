## Professor notes
### Media Effects
Media does affect all of us <br/>
Sometime media's affect is intentional like propogenda, other times, it is not unintentional <br/>
Example: Weather forecast <br/>
Wear a coat or carry umbrella <br/>
Salmonella(food poison) Outbreak, stop eating melon => Affect food industry <br/>
Having bias of white people <br/>
Social network also affects us, but media also does <br/>
Two media effects <br/>
reciprocal effect: ex, boyfried <br/>
Exampe: Kate Middleton, media affected how she act <br/>
George Floyd Murder <br/>
Media coverage made people to do more <br/>
**boomerang effect** <br/>
Media tries to promote some change, but the change is not what you wanted <br/>
Stakes get made <br/>
Story could go viral <br/>
Piece... leave out important information, not the whole thing <br/>
Sometimes, information is excluded, and distortes the meaning <br/>
President Teresa Sullivan resigned <br/>
If getting rid of this university president... <br/>
People in the US couldn't see what is going out there <br/>
What they wanted was banning her, but instead had outpour of support, forced to reelect her <br/>
**Cultivation Theory** <br/>
Exposure to television, shapes our social reality <br/>
Can give us a distorted view <br/>
Reality: World is not as dangerous as we are concerned <br/>
-Prime-time(Evening) television <br/>
Lots of people watch television at that time.. <br/>
-How we see ethnic minority <br/>
Television shows, have an unrealistic view of a specific country in an outsider view <br/>
Not the way it is.. <br/>
-Heavy televisions viewers tend to view the world dangerous compared to the light television viewers <br/>
-See immigration as violence and use the terms invasion <br/>
=> People think we have to stop this <br/>
News start in 11 O'Clock, they do advertisements, and make people think you're gonna die when you don't watch the tv <br/>
-THe odds of being a victim of violence within the next week <br/>
Heavy viewers: Have about a 10% chance <br/>
Light viewers: Have about a 1% chance <br/>
If chance is remote, odds of victims of violence 1 in 10,000 <br/>
Immigrants < Native Americans <br/>
-Think more people are involved in law enforcement and that officers, and think they use weapons much more than they do in reality <br/>
-Television shows, middle class situations <br/>
Poor people don't get the represenetation <br/>
Reason: Have money.. <br/>
Media has business affecting the contents <br/>
-In reality, they are poor <br/>
