### Photos From A U.S. Boot Camp
Tough, gruelling and not fun at all <br/>
### Review Questions
1)Why did the mother send her daughter to boot camp? Why did the daughter’s behaviour change? <br/>
Her daughter started to misbehave, her grades dropped and attitude changed, and she hated going to school. <br/> 
She wanted to help her child to become to the same old daughter as before, and thought sending her to a bootcamp might help <br/>
Reason is parent's divorce, had to move to . 17, difficult age <br/>
After attending the bootcamp, she acknowledged she was wrong and came back to her oldself. <br/>
2)Where did the mother get the idea to send her daughter to boot camp from? <br/>
14-year-old son(brother) was troubled with drugs, but a strict boarding camp changed him. Intense treatment works, do the same to the daughter <br/>
Thought that this would work for her daughter as well <br/>
3)Why did the mother have to rush when making this decision about dealing with her daughter? <br/>
(3)-1 Tuition <br/>
Beauty school fees were due coming up the Saturday and also legally
(3)-2 Age <br/>
She had no control over her daughter when she reaches 18 <br/>
4)What was the mother’s action plan for getting her daughter from their house to the boot camp?  <br/>
At Friday night, the family went to dinner on the pretence that it was to celebrate her new school which was actually to stop her seeing friends and ensure she’d be home for the escorts  <br/>
After their appearance in the middle of the night, the security service flew with her to the Utah desert  <br/>
