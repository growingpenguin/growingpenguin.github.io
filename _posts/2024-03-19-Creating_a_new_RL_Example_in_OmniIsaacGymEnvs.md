A collection of reinforcement learning environments are provided at OmniIsaacGymEnvs, which can be used as examples and baselines to build new RL environments with Isaac Sim <br/>
Details of the tasking framework for running a RL environment <br/>

## Learning Objectives
(1)Introduce the tasking framework <br/>
(2)Implement a Cartpole task <br/>
(3)Register the task to the OIGE framework <br/>
(4)Understand config files for the task <br/>
(5)Run the Cartpole task <br/>


## Getting Started
-Default Python Environment <br/>
