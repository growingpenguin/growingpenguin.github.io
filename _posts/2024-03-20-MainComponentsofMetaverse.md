# Main Components of Metaverse
**Recap of Metaverse** <br/>
Do not want to deal with high data rate, wnat to deal with a lower data rate and try increase user experience <br/>
**Device Level** <br/>
Visual interface <br/>
**Step-by-Step Metaverse** <br/>
Confusion <br/>
Not meaning, user experience efficient enough <br/>
**Basic Diagram of System** <br/>
Input <-> System <-> Output <Br/>
Bidirectional <br/>
Output can go to input, and input can go to output <br/>
Input cases can be a physical format of the human <br/>
User with devices, system, and then output <br/>

With generalization, output can be three types <br/>
1)Within <br/>
Create own world, try to access to the world. Whole thing in the platform, and access into the platform <br/>
2) <br/>
User access to system, interaction will happen <br/>
End to end communication <br/>
=> Confused that metaverse is social networks <br/>
Graphic Module & Virtual Env <br/>
Near end to end with physical object, have difficulty handling <br/>
Physical Object is like a tv screen <br/>
Users flush data, and display images on the display <br/>
-Graphic into data <br/>
More Details.More Interfaces <br/>
Don't bring every pixel, all the data <br/>
Protocol, system, multi-protocol, <br/>


Mirror on the screen <br/>
Send interaction, send data, flushing in the tv screen <Br/>
Smartphon, mirror youtube, and seen in monitor <br/>
Do only one job, phone is controller <br/>



Layer, 3D available, <br/>
Every single one as object <br/>
Object oriented programming, C# <br/>
Layers in Graphic module => Interact system <br/>

Exit, Screen, Chair, all of them are layers <br/>
Buttons are objected, and can be treated as a layer <br/>
