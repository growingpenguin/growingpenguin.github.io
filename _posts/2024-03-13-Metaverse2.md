# Week2
## Motivation
## The Term Metaverse 
Meta: More comprehensive <br/>
Universe: The world of human experience <br/>
## The very somewhat-first Metaverse

Object, space designed by human users <br/>
People chatting <br/>
## Definition of Metaverse
Brand new term and the terms are scattered all over in <br/>
Virtual is somewhat accompanied with this term <br/>
Dictionary itself is somewhat confused <br/>
Physical to Cyber, Cyber to Physical <br/>
Mirror virtal to the physical world. Similar to Digital Twin <br/>
**Often confused with Digital Twin** <br/>

CPS and DT have difference <br/>
DT: Not controlling 
Choose something, but do not change the real world itself <br/>
Copy and paste <br/>
CPS: Action has to be proceeded <br/>
Metaverse virtual happening, also have to happen in the real world <br/>
ex. Smart factories, Manufacturi <br/>
Evaluate -> Verify -> Product designed and make it <br/>
Metaverse intertwine all the concepts <br/>

## CPS Platfom
Not really virtual, but <br/>
Connected cloud, as a cyber <br/>
Send data, action happening as a cyber as well <br/>
Cyber is more like data interaction, structure happening in the machine <br/>
Agricultural Robot appication is cyber <br/>
WEnt too far <br/>
6G communications <br/>
:High speed network, link to cyber space? <br/>
Idealistic, not really happening, don't care about commercialization <br/>

## Metaverse Architecture
-No Definitive Architecture of Metaverse Yet
Don't have standard structure depends on how developer design the architecture <br/>
Layer out, trying to make a standrd system <br/>
Unify as Metaverse Ecosystem & Technology <br/>
Right: <br/>
Layer up <br/>
Interactive more than software system <br/>
Put all the good terms here <br/>

## Platform Structure
Design your metaverse structure <br/>
Infrastruacture + Engine(Platform) + Application(ex. 3D rendering, interaction, and design of objects) <br/>
High speed network + Expensive servers aaare more like infrastructure level <br/>

## Network Structure
-High speed data rate <br/>
More than 1Ggps <br/>
Less than that, too slow, like pixelrated env <br/>
-High throughput rate <br/>
Data rate to secure real time metaverse experience <br/>
-Metaverse plarform to User has to be alight <br/>
5G standardize to AR, bt unfortunately it fails <br/>
5G starts to become part of history and looking forward to 6G <br/>

## Network Structure
**Data Rate Milestone** <br/>
Full 3D, 1Gbps is minimum <br/>
Healthcare portion, Data Rate Req min 10Gbps <br/>
Connected to switch 10Gbps <br/>

## Types of Metaverse
**MEtaverse Type1: 3D Social Network** <br/>
Virtual env + user interactions <br/>
Example: Decentraland <br/>
Interacting together <br/>
Not distributed, high cost <br/>
High computing resources, excessive amount of budget <br/>
**Metaverse Type1: 3D Social Network** <br/>
Very test oriented env <br/>
Physical to virtual, virtual to  <br/>
Viewing, directions will be a lot different <br/>
**Metaverse Type2: Purpose-based** <br/>
Virtualization of Purpose-based <br/>
Environment <br/>
-Virtual Conference Call <br/>
Example: Gather town <br/> 
Digital Campus: Create campus in virtual class <br/>
Daily life in campus in virtual world <br/>
Most company aim to, working forward to <br/>
Hyundai employees gathering, chairman speech <br/>

Translate to different perspectives <br/>
## Metaverse Service Examples
**Minecraft** <br/>
-Sandbox Game fully released in 2011 <br/>
-Iphone4, efficient, and can run own server <br/>
-locally run and <br/>
-Going into certain network <br/>
-Pixelated env. Additional advantage, real created env, go to places <br/>
**Decentraland** <br/>
BS <Br/>
How we created the world <br/>
Real-time Layer > Land Content Layer > Consensus Layer <br/>
Decentralized, sell land inside the virtual env <br/>
Traded token nft <br/>
Distributed network structure <br/>
decentralized autonomous <br/>
Company, logo and brand, using for advertising purposes. Purchased digital asset <br/>
-Try something on ? <br/>
-3D-based Virtual World in 2020 <br/>
Browser based ip, web url can access the virtual world <Br/>
SImple to access than installing <br/>
2~3 minutes to get in there <br/>
**Gathertown** <br/>
Emulated game style appealing to many companies <br/>
Simplified 2D platform also treated as a new metaverse space <br/>
Pixelated style, game style <br/>
Chat, far away, cannot hear <br/>
Many organizations used this <br/>
## Metaverse Platform/Service Example4
Financial Sectors <br/>
-KB <br/>
Sensation, wearing headstep, type in with the controller, not making any sense <br/>
Required to have a VR headset <br/>
-Shinhan and Wooribank <br/>
Shinhan <br/>
Much more reasonable <br/>
Saving services, investment, walk around like getting advantages, try to do something <br/>
Woori <br/>
Used Geppeto Platform <br/>
=> Conservative companies. Try to put everything under their platform. But it failed <br/>
-Spain CaixaBank <br/>
Bought a land, banking service to docker <br/>
Not work as they thought <br/>
Integrate banking service to metaverse <br/>
Existing world with <b
Difference <br/>
They want to build their own world, communicate, excess in that world <br/>
Try to connect with existing virtual world <br/>
New users access real world, user friendly <br/>
-Credit Suisse <br/>
Metaverse Eco-system <br/>
Consumer-Enterprise Users <br/>
Software + Hardware + Semiconductors(Operate in any kind of devices) <br/>
Telecom Services, korea there <br/>
Very limited amount of entities, we have metaverse alliance and doesn't work as it is <br/>

Considered new technology <br/>
5 stages <br/>
Middle ground crashed, has a potential to grow up again <Br/>
Big coin <br/>
Peak -> Crash -> Coming back <br/>
=> Gardner, Metaverse is at the beginning 2022 <br/>
Now <br/>
AI is going on the top, and AI is everywhere, metaverse gone? Remove it? <br/>
## Technology 
Trend Rador <br/>
View where technology stands <br/>
Far from the future, there are potentials, <br/>
Decentralized Identity: Identity in digital way <br/>
Not happen very soon, not popular next 5 years, but will become popular in 6~8 years <br/>
Marked as Triangle; will be more than 10 years <br/>
-Usually industry adapted -> Consumer start to use technology <br/>
Multimodal UI: Everyone always using it <br/>

**3D Graphics** <br/>
-Rendering and Computation are all we matters <br/>

Simple device like watches <br/>
=> Real world experience already in computer laptop.. <br/>
Example: Unreal Engine <br/>
Making 3D world like boundary between unreal and real... Unreal looking like real one <br/>

**Device Level** <br/>
-VR Headset is the major one <br/>
Example: <br/> 
-Google Glass (Google cardboard..) <br/>
-Meta Quest3 <br/>
Really into making this devices <br/>
MetaQuest only used for wifi module. Need to be at home, stationary <br/>
1/5 Apple Vision Pro <br/>
-Apple Vision Pro <br/>
UI for computer <br/>
Apple has an interest in metaverse as well <Br/>

**Newtork Level** <br/>
5G failes, everyone talking about 6G <br/>
Wifi, but cellular network, not get the full experience of metaverse <br/>

**Platform** <br/>
-Cloud, SGN <br/>
-Different level of architectre and Platform <br/>
General sense of architecture, but how they build it depends on companies <br/>
## Platform Business Type
Deciding on the right platform is a complex question <br/>
Should we focus on development, payment processing, or another area? <br/>

## Trends in Automative Mobility Fields
-Advertising campaign  <br/>
-Floating around the 3D Rendering

**Automative OEMs** <br/>
Designed their vehicle, play vehicles into the game <br/>
-BMW JOYTOPIA Platform <br/>
Created their own platform <br/>
Try to find a new business, What kind of new business is mixed up <br/>

**ICT Company** <br/>

**Automative Industries** <br/>
-Progress has been made <br/>
They don't have what is happening in the vehicle <br/>

**Mobility Services** <br/>
Target vehicle to create something new <br/>
Micromobility <br/>
No way full metaverse experience <br/>

**Future Communication** <br/>
-Metaverse needs much significant bandwidths and network capability <br/>
2030 6G <br/>

## Think about Metaverse 
McKinsey Proposal 
10 layers, but professor 
Enabler: more like application <br/>
https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-the-metaverse <br/>
Telecommunications far behind <br/>

## Think about Metaverse
Still people think about metaverse, in a simple way <br/>
People far behind it, but realizing a little bit <br/>
Virtual world, expecting same experience as the real world <br/>
This scope is a view of the customers <br/>
**Metaverse Experiences** <br/>
NFT almost died <br/>
**Experiences Wanted** <br/>
Senior executives look like.. <picture?> <br/>
