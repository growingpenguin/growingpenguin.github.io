# Week2
## Motivation
## The Term Metaverse 
Meta: More comprehensive <br/>
Universe: The world of human experience <br/>
## The very somewhat-first Metaverse

Object, space designed by human users <br/>
People chatting <br/>
## Definition of Metaverse
Brand new term and the terms are scattered all over in <br/>
Virtual is somewhat accompanied with this term <br/>
Dictionary itself is somewhat confused <br/>
Physical to Cyber, Cyber to Physical <br/>
Mirror virtal to the physical world. Similar to Digital Twin <br/>
**Often confused with Digital Twin** <br/>

CPS and DT have difference <br/>
DT: Not controlling 
Choose something, but do not change the real world itself <br/>
Copy and paste <br/>
CPS: Action has to be proceeded <br/>
Metaverse virtual happening, also have to happen in the real world <br/>
ex. Smart factories, Manufacturi <br/>
Evaluate -> Verify -> Product designed and make it <br/>
Metaverse intertwine all the concepts <br/>

## CPS Platfom
Not really virtual, but <br/>
Connected cloud, as a cyber <br/>
Send data, action happening as a cyber as well <br/>
Cyber is more like data interaction, structure happening in the machine <br/>
Agricultural Robot appication is cyber <br/>
WEnt too far <br/>
6G communications <br/>
:High speed network, link to cyber space? <br/>
Idealistic, not really happening, don't care about commercialization <br/>

## Metaverse Architecture
-No Definitive Architecture of Metaverse Yet
Don't have standard structure depends on how developer design the architecture <br/>
Layer out, trying to make a standrd system <br/>
Unify as Metaverse Ecosystem & Technology <br/>
Right: <br/>
Layer up <br/>
Interactive more than software system <br/>
Put all the good terms here <br/>

## Platform Structure
Design your metaverse structure <br/>
Infrastruacture + Engine(Platform) + Application(ex. 3D rendering, interaction, and design of objects) <br/>
High speed network + Expensive servers aaare more like infrastructure level <br/>

## Network Structure
-High speed data rate <br/>
More than 1Ggps <br/>
Less than that, too slow, like pixelrated env <br/>
-High throughput rate <br/>
Data rate to secure real time metaverse experience <br/>
-Metaverse plarform to User has to be alight <br/>
5G standardize to AR, bt unfortunately it fails <br/>
5G starts to become part of history and looking forward to 6G <br/>

## Network Structure
**Data Rate Milestone** <br/>
Full 3D, 1Gbps is minimum <br/>
Healthcare portion, Data Rate Req min 10Gbps <br/>
Connected to switch 10Gbps <br/>

## Types of Metaverse
**MEtaverse Type1: 3D Social Network** <br/>
Virtual env + user interactions <br/>
Example: Decentraland <br/>
Interacting together <br/>
Not distributed, high cost <br/>
High computing resources, excessive amount of budget <br/>
**Metaverse Type1: 3D Social Network** <br/>
Very test oriented env <br/>
Physical to virtual, virtual to  <br/>
Viewing, directions will be a lot different <br/>
**Metaverse Type2: Purpose-based** <br/>
Virtualization of Purpose-based <br/>
Environment 

-Virtual Conference Call <br/>
Example: Gather town <br/> 
Digital Campus: Create campus in virtual class <br/>
Daily life in campus in virtual world <br/>
Most company aim to, working forward to <br/>
Hyundai employees gathering, chairman speech <br/>

Translate to different perspectives <br/>
