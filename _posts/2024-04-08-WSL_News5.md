## Words
Stoning: <br/>
A form of capital punishment where a group of people throw stones at a person until they die <br/>
This method of execution has historically been used in various cultures and is associated with punishment for certain crimes, often adultery or other offenses considered severe under specific legal or religious laws <br/>
edict: <br/>
A formal proclamation or order issued by an authority <br/>
In this case, the term refers to a decree made by the Taliban, acting as the governing authority in parts of Afghanistan, to officially reinstate the practice of stoning women to death for particular violations <br/>
The use of the word "edict" implies that this decision is a top-down directive that is meant to be followed and enforced across the territories under Taliban control <br/>
regime: <br/>
The government in power, especially one considered authoritarian or dictatorial <br/>
In this case, it refers to the Taliban's governance in Afghanistan <br/> 
flogging: <br/>
A form of corporal punishment where an individual is beaten with a whip, stick, or similar implement <br/>
It is used as a penalty for various offenses under some legal systems, including those based on the Taliban's interpretation of Sharia law <br/>
Flogging, like stoning, is considered by many human rights organizations to be a cruel and inhumane form of punishment <br/>
accountable: <br/>
Being held responsible or answerable for one's actions or the actions of an organization or government <br/>
It implies an obligation to explain, justify, and take responsibility for actions, particularly those that have significant ethical, legal, or social implications <br/>
condemned <br/>
To doom or subject someone to a particularly bad situation or fate <br/>
The activists' statement suggests that the announcement (likely referring to policies or actions taken by the Taliban concerning women's rights) has effectively doomed  <br/>
adultery <br/>
The act of engaging in sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse, considered a violation of marriage vows <br/>
democratic <br/>
Principles or values associated with democracy, a form of government in which power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system <br/>
Democratic principles often include respect for human rights, equality, freedom of expression, and the rule of law <br/>
These principles contrast sharply with the actions and justifications provided by the speaker, who defends the public stoning or flogging of women for adultery as being in accordance with their interpretation of religious law, implicitly criticizing democratic values for being incompatible with their practices <br/>
