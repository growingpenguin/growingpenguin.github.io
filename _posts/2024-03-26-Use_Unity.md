# Use Unity Hands on
## Make a Project
To make a game by Unity, We need to first make a project <br/>
There is a project and a scene <br/>
project: Entire game<br/>
scene: Unit of a scene <br/>
If you compare it to a play, each script is a project, and each scene is a scene <br/>
(1)Double click Unity Hub and execute Unity <br/>
(2)Click project <br/>
When the screen opens, click on the project to display the project screen <br/>

(3)Click New project <br/>

(4)Project Configuration <br/>

When you click on a new project, the project settings screen appears <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1cdc8471-1d5b-4690-99ff-f33864875b06) <br/>
Select all templates from the left column. Since we are making a 3D sample here, choose 3D from the template items <br/>
Enter the project name as Test <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/d662c738-9506-4e26-9397-55c8b30ca120) <br/>
When you click Create Project at the bottom right, the project will be created in the specified folder, and the Unity Editor will run <br/>
-Unity was originally developed as a tool for creating 3D games. However, now with added features, it is also used as a tool for creating 2D games. <br/>
Whether to do it in 3D or 2D can be selected when creating a project, as in the example <br/>
## Add a hexahedron
(1)Unity Editor Executed <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on6](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/ae6a867e-1d2c-4027-af88-e64a8ec58d23) <br/>
When you run the Unity Editor, the following screen appears (If the screen looks different, click on the Scene tab that appears above the Game view.) <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on7](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fc1df0ad-735d-4e11-95ff-c921a8a7522b) <br/>
In the Scene view in the middle of the screen, there are icons for a camera and the sun. 
camera: camera object <br/>
sun: the light that illuminates the entire game <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/776da58d-de1b-499e-b7ce-87d24b8fa24b) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, a list corresponding to these objects (Main Camera and Directional Light) appears <br/>
(2)Add cube object <br/>
Let's add a cube object to the scene view <br/>
Unity has a variety of resources available for use when making games, such as cubes and spheres <br/>
You can create a simple game stage just by combining these resources <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b8d7f3f5-b7d9-45f5-b86c-8ec433c464db) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, click the + to select 3D Object -> Cube <br/>
A cube is added to the center of the Scene view <br/>

At the same time, a Cube is also added to the Hierarchy window <br/>
Right after adding, the object name is in edit mode, so click somewhere or press Enter to finalize the name <br/>
Remember that the objects in the Scene view correspond one-to-one with the list of objects in the Hierarchy window <br/>
