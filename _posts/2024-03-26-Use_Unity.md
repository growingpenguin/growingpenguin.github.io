# Use Unity Hands on
## Make a Project
To make a game by Unity, We need to first make a project <br/>
There is a project and a scene <br/>
project: Entire game<br/>
scene: Unit of a scene <br/>
If you compare it to a play, each script is a project, and each scene is a scene <br/>
(1)Double click Unity Hub and execute Unity <br/>
(2)Click project <br/>
When the screen opens, click on the project to display the project screen <br/>

(3)Click New project <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/85ebff21-7b44-44b2-8664-f2b310405875) <br/>
(4)Project Configuration <br/>

When you click on a new project, the project settings screen appears <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1cdc8471-1d5b-4690-99ff-f33864875b06) <br/>
Select all templates from the left column. Since we are making a 3D sample here, choose 3D from the template items <br/>
Enter the project name as Test <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/d662c738-9506-4e26-9397-55c8b30ca120) <br/>
When you click Create Project at the bottom right, the project will be created in the specified folder, and the Unity Editor will run <br/>
-Unity was originally developed as a tool for creating 3D games. However, now with added features, it is also used as a tool for creating 2D games. <br/>
Whether to do it in 3D or 2D can be selected when creating a project, as in the example <br/>
## Add a hexahedron
(1)Unity Editor Executed <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on6](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/ae6a867e-1d2c-4027-af88-e64a8ec58d23) <br/>
When you run the Unity Editor, the following screen appears (If the screen looks different, click on the Scene tab that appears above the Game view.) <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on7](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fc1df0ad-735d-4e11-95ff-c921a8a7522b) <br/>
In the Scene view in the middle of the screen, there are icons for a camera and the sun. 
camera: camera object <br/>
sun: the light that illuminates the entire game <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/776da58d-de1b-499e-b7ce-87d24b8fa24b) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, a list corresponding to these objects (Main Camera and Directional Light) appears <br/>
(2)Add cube object <br/>
Let's add a cube object to the scene view <br/>
Unity has a variety of resources available for use when making games, such as cubes and spheres <br/>
You can create a simple game stage just by combining these resources <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b8d7f3f5-b7d9-45f5-b86c-8ec433c464db) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, click the + to select 3D Object -> Cube <br/>
A cube is added to the center of the Scene view <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/cd1f01ae-86a7-43d3-b7c3-059c65a8fd5f) <br/>
At the same time, a Cube is also added to the Hierarchy window <br/>
Right after adding, the object name is in edit mode, so click somewhere or press Enter to finalize the name <br/>
Remember that the objects in the Scene view correspond one-to-one with the list of objects in the Hierarchy window <br/>
(3)Axis of the object <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on11](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1831a4c4-f4e4-4d64-a97c-7283fb2a3be8) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, click on the Cube <br/>
The detailed information of the Cube appears in the Inspector window on the right side of the screen <br/>
Thus, the detailed information of the object selected in the Hierarchy window is displayed in the Inspector window <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on12](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/9f958934-d189-4181-bbcb-fc4c6fe4d6d3) <br/>
Just as the location on a map is determined by 'latitude' and 'longitude', the position of an object within a scene is represented by three coordinate values: X, Y, and Z <br/>
If you look at the Position value in the Transform section of the Inspector window, X, Y, and Z are all 0 <br/>
This means that the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the object are all 0, respectively <br/>
This point, where X, Y, and Z are all 0, is known as the origin <br/>
(4)Axis of the camera <br/>
Camera Coordinates <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on13](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/3d6a3bab-d533-473f-86b1-2a6e8e498ef7) <br/>
Click on Main Camera in the Hierarchy window <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on14](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/6d3de14f-b0d5-4360-826b-96cc749ae7c6) <br/>
The detailed information of the Main Camera appears in the Inspector window <br/>
If you look at the Position value in the Transform section, the camera coordinates are 0, 1, -10 <br/>
-When you click on the Main Camera in the Hierarchy window, the screen captured by the camera appears in the bottom right of the Scene view <br/>
