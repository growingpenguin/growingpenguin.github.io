# Use Unity Hands on
## Make a Project
To make a game by Unity, We need to first make a project <br/>
There is a project and a scene <br/>
project: Entire game<br/>
scene: Unit of a scene <br/>
If you compare it to a play, each script is a project, and each scene is a scene <br/>
(1)Double click Unity Hub and execute Unity <br/>
(2)Click project <br/>
When the screen opens, click on the project to display the project screen <br/>
