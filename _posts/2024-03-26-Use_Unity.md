# Use Unity Hands on
## Make a Project
To make a game by Unity, We need to first make a project <br/>
There is a project and a scene <br/>
project: Entire game<br/>
scene: Unit of a scene <br/>
If you compare it to a play, each script is a project, and each scene is a scene <br/>
(1)Double click Unity Hub and execute Unity <br/>
(2)Click project <br/>
When the screen opens, click on the project to display the project screen <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on1](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/34ba0a33-de72-4f89-80ec-ce4b3411f8b0) <br/>
(3)Click New project <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/85ebff21-7b44-44b2-8664-f2b310405875) <br/>
(4)Project Configuration <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/aaefe0d3-550b-4fa1-8a91-0f6fc2acfb1f) <br/>
When you click on a new project, the project settings screen appears <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1cdc8471-1d5b-4690-99ff-f33864875b06) <br/>
Select all templates from the left column. Since we are making a 3D sample here, choose 3D from the template items <br/>
Enter the project name as Test <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/d662c738-9506-4e26-9397-55c8b30ca120) <br/>
When you click Create Project at the bottom right, the project will be created in the specified folder, and the Unity Editor will run <br/>
-Unity was originally developed as a tool for creating 3D games. However, now with added features, it is also used as a tool for creating 2D games. <br/>
Whether to do it in 3D or 2D can be selected when creating a project, as in the example <br/>
## Add a hexahedron
(1)Unity Editor Executed <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on6](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/ae6a867e-1d2c-4027-af88-e64a8ec58d23) <br/>
When you run the Unity Editor, the following screen appears (If the screen looks different, click on the Scene tab that appears above the Game view.) <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on7](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fc1df0ad-735d-4e11-95ff-c921a8a7522b) <br/>
In the Scene view in the middle of the screen, there are icons for a camera and the sun. 
camera: camera object <br/>
sun: the light that illuminates the entire game <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/776da58d-de1b-499e-b7ce-87d24b8fa24b) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, a list corresponding to these objects (Main Camera and Directional Light) appears <br/>
(2)Add cube object <br/>
Let's add a cube object to the scene view <br/>
Unity has a variety of resources available for use when making games, such as cubes and spheres <br/>
You can create a simple game stage just by combining these resources <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/b8d7f3f5-b7d9-45f5-b86c-8ec433c464db) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, click the + to select 3D Object -> Cube <br/>
A cube is added to the center of the Scene view <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/cd1f01ae-86a7-43d3-b7c3-059c65a8fd5f) <br/>
At the same time, a Cube is also added to the Hierarchy window <br/>
Right after adding, the object name is in edit mode, so click somewhere or press Enter to finalize the name <br/>
Remember that the objects in the Scene view correspond one-to-one with the list of objects in the Hierarchy window <br/>
(3)Axis of the object <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on11](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/1831a4c4-f4e4-4d64-a97c-7283fb2a3be8) <br/>
In the Hierarchy window, click on the Cube <br/>
The detailed information of the Cube appears in the Inspector window on the right side of the screen <br/>
Thus, the detailed information of the object selected in the Hierarchy window is displayed in the Inspector window <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on12](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/9f958934-d189-4181-bbcb-fc4c6fe4d6d3) <br/>
Just as the location on a map is determined by 'latitude' and 'longitude', the position of an object within a scene is represented by three coordinate values: X, Y, and Z <br/>
If you look at the Position value in the Transform section of the Inspector window, X, Y, and Z are all 0 <br/>
This means that the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the object are all 0, respectively <br/>
This point, where X, Y, and Z are all 0, is known as the origin <br/>
(4)Axis of the camera <br/>
Camera Coordinates <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on13](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/3d6a3bab-d533-473f-86b1-2a6e8e498ef7) <br/>
Click on Main Camera in the Hierarchy window <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on14](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/6d3de14f-b0d5-4360-826b-96cc749ae7c6) <br/>
The detailed information of the Main Camera appears in the Inspector window <br/>
If you look at the Position value in the Transform section, the camera coordinates are 0, 1, -10 <br/>
-When you click on the Main Camera in the Hierarchy window, the screen captured by the camera appears in the bottom right of the Scene view <br/>
-In the Inspector window, it was found that the coordinates of the cube are 0, 0, 0, and the coordinates of the camera are 0, 1, -10. <br/>
-In Unity, the ability to understand space is very important for making 3D games <br/>
When grasping the space, what is displayed are the origin and the camera position. It is good to decide exactly what to place where before making the game <br/>
(5)Lighting Configuration <br/>
When you place a 3D model, depending on the Unity version, the model may appear dark <br/>
If the display of the 3D model is dark, select Window -> Rendering -> Lighting from the toolbar, open the Scene tab in the Lighting window <br/>
And click Generate Lighting at the bottom (if Auto Generate on the left is checked, uncheck it) <br/>
=> Not applicable <br/>
(6)Run the Game <br/>
I will try to run the game using the execution tools located at the top of the screen <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on15](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/78cbbab4-27eb-4073-94bb-a0eafebaeac6) <br/>
Each button on the execution tool is, from left to right, Run, Pause, Step <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on16](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/68df79c3-433a-44db-af56-f1d824870bcd) <br/>
The image being captured by the camera placed in the Scene view so far (Main Camera) appears <br/>
A cube appears in the center of the execution screen <br/>
Click on Run, which is the first tool of the execution tool <br/>
Clicking the run tool once more will stop the game and return you to the Scene view <br/>
Like this, the image captured by the camera becomes the game execution screen <br/>
-If the camera moves away from the subject, the subject appearing on the game execution screen becomes smaller Conversely, if the camera gets closer to the subject, the subject appearing on the execution screen becomes larger <br/>
(7)Saving the scene <br/>
Saves the created scene <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on18](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/3b3f08c8-5d85-4700-9d02-96383d76f05c) <br/>
You can save the scene by selecting File -> Save As from the toolbar, which will open a window for saving the scene. <br/>
You can name it whatever you like, but here, enter TestScene in Save As and click Save (on Windows, enter the filename as TestScene and click save) <br/>
(8)Manipulating the Viewpoint in the Scene View <br/>
Let's look at how to move the viewpoint (zoom, pan, rotate) <br/>
The movement here refers solely to the developer's perspective and does not affect the appearance of the game when it is running <br/>
Zooming In and Out of the Viewpoint <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on19](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/9ac81962-e734-4ccb-b5a9-9ab5cf53889e) <br/>
zoom in <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on20](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/402725df-4d69-4666-bc0e-f2945e7dc5f7) <br/>
zoom out <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on21](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5b347763-249c-46e7-8769-157d619e49b3) <br/>
Zooming in and out of the scene is controlled with the mouse wheel. Pushing the mouse wheel up zooms in on the entire scene in the Scene view, and pulling it down zooms out (this can be reversed depending on computer settings). The screen zooms in and out according to the scroll <br/>
(9)Panning the Viewpoint <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on22](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/dd5f4933-f862-4948-8589-3f2da6a9d406) <br/>
To pan the viewpoint in the Scene view, click on the hand tool in the toolbar <br/>
Once the hand tool is selected, the mouse pointer changes to a hand shape <br/> 
In this state, dragging the screen will move the screen in the direction of the drag (the same operation can be performed by dragging while clicking the mouse wheel). <br/>
![Use_Unity_Hands_on23](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/2e8f9170-a4f7-4f51-9015-cefc2b135242) <br/>
(10)Rotating the Viewpoint <br/> 
Holding down the Alt key and dragging the screen rotates the viewpoint's position in the Scene view. When the Alt key is pressed, the icon changes to an eye shape, and dragging in this state will rotate the viewpoint. The Scene Gizmo in the upper right corner of the screen rotates together with it. The Scene Gizmo acts like a directional magnet, indicating the direction you are facing.
