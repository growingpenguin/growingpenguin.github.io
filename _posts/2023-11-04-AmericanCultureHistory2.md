# American Indians Living Conditions
22% of the 5.2 Million American Indians in the US live in tribal lands called reservations <br/>
Living conditions have been cited as "comparable to the Third World" (Living in conditions of poverty and lack of necessities)<br/>
Many factors contributed to the challenges indigenous Americans face today, but pressing issues exist in economics, health, and housing<br/>
<br/>
## Employment
Problem: Unemployment, Government benefits and poverty wages, Forced to leave reservation for work   <br/>
Tribal and Federal governments are the largest employers of reservations, private industries lack on reservations <br/>
Many households are overcrowded and earn only government benefits (Social security, Veteran income, or Disability) <br/>
4/10 ~ 8/10 adults are unemployed in reservations, and indegenous Americans who are employed, many are earning below poverty wages <br/>
28.2 percent of African Americans live below the poverty line and 38 ~ 63 percent of the African Americans living in poverty on the reservations <br/>
Heads of households are forced to leave reservation to seek work, grandparents raise their grandchildren <br/>
Extended families pool(collect) meager(insufficient) resources to meet basic needs <br/>
Poverty still extended by these blended families is understood as a gap between overall need and need that goes unmet <br/>
(Blended families are likely to live in poverty than nuclear families) <br/>
## Housing 
Problem: Homelessness, Overcrowding, Substandard housing, Absence of utilities <br/>
Indian country has a severe housing crisis(critical situation) despite IHA(Indian Housing Authority)s efforts<br/>
Need for adequate housing is intense <br/>
90,000 homeless or under-housed Indian families exist, 30% of the reservation housing is overcrowded and less than 50% of the reservation housing is related to public sewers <br/>
Many American Indians are living in substandard housing (40% of reservation houses are considered inadequate) <br/>
Waiting list for tribal housing is long, needing three years or more waits <br/>
As Indian families do not turn away family members or anyone who needs a place to stay, overcrowding is inevitable <br/>
Noticeable absence of utilites <br/>
On a seriously stretched budget, utilities are viewed as luxuries compared to food and transportation. <br/>
Combination of overcrowding, substandard dwellings, and lack of utilities has significantly increased the potential for health risk, <br/>
(Especially in rural and remote areas where there is a lack of accessible healthcare) <br/>
## Health 
problem: Low life expectancy, Indian Health Service low of funds, Small number of Pharmacies or doctoral service outside the communities, Health and welfare problems <br/>
Average life expectancy for indigenous Americans has improved, yet it still trails that of other Americans by 5 years <br/>
55% of American Indians rely on Indian Health Service for medical care, yet this agency meets only 60% of health needs <br/>
Due to underfunding, Indian Health Service is crisis driven leaves a wide gap in adequate and preventative health care for many people on reservations <br/>
Compounding the problem further, pharmancies and offices outside of hospitals are completely non-existent in some communities <br/>
Pressures to shift from traditional way of life toward a Western life style dramatically impacted the health and welfare of Native people and created terrible epidemic of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, and cancer. <br/>
