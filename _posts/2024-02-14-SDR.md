Chose GNU Radio version 3.8.x with Python 3 support (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS supports Python3.8)<br/>
Reference: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Draft-AN-445#Building_and_installing_UHD_from_source_code <br/>
**Building and installing UHD from source code** <br/>
(1) Navigate to Home Directory <br/>
```
cd $HOME/
```
Open a terminal and navigate to your home directory <br/>
(2) Clone the UHD Repository into your home directory <br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd.git
cd $HOME/uhd
```
Clone the UHD source code into your home directory and navigate into it <br/>
(3) Switch to a Specific Branch <br/>
```
git checkout v3.15.0.0
```
Switch to the desired branch for a specific version of UHD (e.g., version 3.15.0.0) <br/>
(4) Prepare Build Directory <br/>
```
cd host
mkdir build
cd build
```
Navigate to the host directory inside uhd, create a build directory <br/>
(5) Configure Installation Path <br/>
```
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../
```
Run cmake to configure the build system, setting the installation prefix to /usr/local (or the prefix where GNU Radio is installed) <br/>
(6) Build and Install <br/>
(make -j3 will use 3 threads in the build) <br/>
```
make -j3
make test
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
(Specify at most one less than the number of CPU cores so the system does not appear to 'freeze' during the build <br/>
If not specified, then a single thread is used for the build) <br/>
-Compile the UHD library using make <br/>
Adjust the -j option based on your CPU cores (using at most one less than the total number of cores to prevent the system from freezing) <br/>
-Run tests to verify the build <br/>
-Install UHD to the specified prefix and update the system's library cache <br/>
(7) Configure Environment Variables <br/>
To ensure your system recognizes the installed libraries, add the UHD library path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable <br/>
```
nano ~/.bashrc 
```
Open ~/.bashrc with nano or your preferred text editor <br/>
```
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Add the following line at the end of the file <br/>
Save and close the file. Apply the changes by sourcing ~/.bashrc or reopening your terminal <br/>

**Linux Install From Source** <br/>
From Source <br/>
For GNU Radio 3.8 or Earlier <br/>
Installing GNU Radio <br/>
(1) Navigate to the Home Directory and Clone the Repository <br/>
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio.git
cd gnuradio
```
Change to your home directory and clone the GNU Radio repository <br/>
(2) Selecting the Version to Install <br/>
```
git checkout maint-3.8
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
```
(If you prefer to install version 3.7, replace maint-3.8 with maint-3.7 in the command above) <br/>
-Update submodules and prepare the build directory <br/>
(3) Configuring the Build <br/>
Configure Installation Options <br/>
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 ../
make -j3 (e.g. if you want to use 3 CPU cores during the build. To use 8 do -j8, to use all cores use -j$(nproc), to use 1 leave out the -j flag.)
```
-Specify the installation prefix (where GNU Radio will be installed) if you don't want the default /usr/local. Replace XXX with your desired installation path <br/>
-To build, decide how many CPU cores you'd like to use <br/>
For 3 cores, use make -j3 <br/>
-To use all available cores <br/>
Replace 3 with $(nproc) <br/>
(4) Building and Testing <br/>
```
make test
sudo make install
```
Build, Test, and Install <br/>
-Compile GNU Radio, Run tests(it's normal for some tests to fail due to missing optional dependencies), and Install GNU Radio <br/>
Error: <br/>
```
The following tests FAILED:
	 25 - qa_volk_32f_8u_polarbutterflypuppet_32f (Failed)
```
Can be ignored.. <br/>
Ref: https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/340 <br/>
(5) Finalizing the Installation <br/>
```
sudo ldconfig
```
Update the System's Library Cache: Important to refresh the system's library paths after installation <br/>
**ModuleNotFoundError** <br/>
(1) Identifying the GNU Radio Installation Prefix <br/>
To resolve a ModuleNotFoundError, you first need to find out where GNU Radio is installed on your system <br/>
This information is necessary for ensuring that your environment is correctly set up to find GNU Radio modules <br/>
```
gnuradio-config-info --prefix
```
![gnuradio4](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/fe89a4c0-edd2-4de5-b332-6203057e66c3) <br/>
Once you have the GNU Radio installation prefix, you'll use this path in place of {your-prefix} in any subsequent commands that require specifying the installation location of GNU Radio <br/>
(2) Finding the Python library <br/>
Using a terminal, enter the following command, substituting the prefix you found above in place of {your-prefix}: <br/>
```
find {your-prefix} -name gnuradio | grep "packages"
#ME
find /usr/local -name gnuradio | grep "packages"
```
![gnuradio5](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/552cbe24-056a-48e0-b249-8b7950a73c46) <br/>
Find the Python library paths associated with GNU Radio. These paths are necessary to ensure that your Python environment can correctly locate and import GNU Radio modules <br/>
Put the appropriate paths it found into the export commands below. Note that the paths are separated by colons : <br/>
In the terminal, execute the following command. Remember to replace {your-prefix} with the actual installation prefix you discovered previously <br/>
(3) Setting PYTHONPATH <br/>
```
export PYTHONPATH={your-prefix}/lib/{Py-version}/dist-packages:{your-prefix}/lib/{Py-version}/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
#ME
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
```
-Use the following template to set your PYTHONPATH, replacing {your-prefix} with your GNU Radio installation prefix and {Py-version} with your Python version (e.g., python3.8) <br/>
-On Debian, Ubuntu, and similar systems, as well as on most 32-bit Unix/Linux systems, the paths typically follow this structure <br/>
(4) Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Optional) <br/>
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={your-prefix}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Ensure that the system's dynamic linker/loader can find the GNU Radio libraries <br/>
(5) Store the commands in a Bash start-up file <br/>
```
nano ~/.bashrc 
```
-Add the Export Commands <br/>
At the end of the file, paste the export commands you constructed for PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH <br/>
-Save and Close the Editor <br/>
After adding the lines, save the changes and close the editor <br/>
Press Ctrl + O, Enter, and then Ctrl + X <br/>
(6) Applying the Changes <br/>
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Source your .bashrc file <br/>
(7) Open gnuradio <br/>
```
gnuradio-companion
```

**Use osmocom Gnu Radio Blocks** <br/>
By using the OsmoSDR block you can take advantage of a common software api in your application(s) independent of the underlying radio hardware <br/>
Setting Up the Build Environment <br/>
(1) Clone the gr-osmosdr Repository <br/>
```
git clone https://git.osmocom.org/sdr/gr-osmosdr.git
cd gr-osmosdr/
```
=> **Updated** <br/>
```
git clone https://gitea.osmocom.org/sdr/gr-osmosdr
cd gr-osmosdr/
```
Building with cmake <br/>
(2) Switch to the Relevant Branch <br/>
```
git checkout gr3.8 
```
(3) Preparing the Build <br/>
Initialize the Build Directory <br/>
```
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
```
![gnuradio8](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/25a0815c-b6ed-4136-925a-b6b99b80d81b) <br/>
(4) Customizing the Build <br/>
Review Component Status <br/>
After running cmake, it will summarize which components are enabled or disabled. This step is crucial for ensuring that the specific functionalities you need are available. If a desired component is listed as disabled, it usually indicates missing dependencies <br/>
Now cmake should print out a summary of enabled/disabled components <br/>
You may disable certain components by following guidelines shown by cmake <br/>
Make sure the device of your interest is listed here. Check your dependencies and retry otherwise <br/>
(5) Install Missing Dependencies <br/>
```
sudo apt install libsoapysdr
```
Install any additional packages that are required. <br/>
For example, if libsoapysdr was listed as a missing dependency, you can install it and its development headers with <br/>
Enter libsoapysdr package installation > Enter tab <br/>
Confirm that the package exists <br/>
(6) Install extra packages that were listed as disabled <br/>
```
sudo apt install libsoapysdr-dev
```
(7) Verifying the Configuration <br/>
```
cd ~/gr-osmosdr/build/
cmake ../
```
Reconfigure to Check Changes <br/>
After installing the missing dependencies, return to your gr-osmosdr build directory and rerun cmake to update the configuration <br/>
This step will verify if the previously disabled components are now enabled, thanks to the installed dependencies <br/>
