# Orientation
## Introduction of the Course
Grasp concept of the metaverse <br/>
Own virtual env using Unity using turtlebot3 <br/>
## Need to Know
Lecture slides provided as pdf <br/>
## Expectation
-Technical details can be provided <br/>
-Graphical deveopment & Programming <br/>
-Unity & Programming Exercising(Build Own Server and Integrating into it) <br/>
-4~5 assignments (Maybe 4) <br/>
## Textbook
그림으로 이해하고 만들면서 익히는 유니티 교과서 개정 6판 <br/>
## If you have Questions
ChatGpt <br/>
## Minimum Requirement
Use a lot of source codes <br/>
(Unity uses C#) <br/>

## Coding Environment
-Any IDE Allowed <br/>
-Robot Integration, use Ubuntu OS (20.04 LTS) <br/>
-Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & Windows recommended <br/>
-For IDE, Terminal(Vim Editor) or Unity Env will be used <br/>
-Minimum Candidate of the programming Language <br/>
C#, Python, Nodejs <br/>

## Metaverse
CPS < < < Metaverse? <br/>
CPS (Cyber Physical System) <br/>

## CPS (Cyber Physical System)
-From National Science Foundation <br/>
-Common Keywords: computation, control, and communication <br/>
cybernets
Integration: Virtual models together <br/>
Virtual to physical, physical to virtual <Br/>
Digital twin: 
Mirror physical world to virtual(Copy paste) <br/>
NOn vice versa <br/>
Bigger picture <br/>

## Metaverse
-Snow Crash <br/>
-Various Terminology <br/>
Blur line between metaverse and digital twin(Used more in technical field) <br/>
-See virtual world -> Modify with their own hand <br/>
-Metaverse also want to affect virtual to the physical system <br/>
Physical space, Physcial system should not be forgotten <br/>
[Picture Description] <br/>
-Physical -> Mirror to Digital Twin -> Want it to be together <br/>
-Metaverse: Human has to be integrated together? <br/>
OPtional requirement <br/>
-Between entities and objects should be integrated (Reward & Penalty) <br/>
Reward & Penalty related to financial interests <br/>

## Immediate View of Metaverse
View of 3D Simulation or Virtual Space <br/>
(Owned by various entities) <br/>
World avatar, running around, doing what they want(Perceived to people) <br/>

## Stack of Metaverse Architecture
**Example of Metaverse Architecture** <br/>
Multi-Layer Structure with Abstract level of Elements <br/>
How to run the metaverse world so that it doesn't die? <br/>
ex. Entity crowd sourcing?? <br/>

## Why Unity Programming
Unity <br/>
-Graphical Design Tool for virtual space and environment creation <br/>
-Who is going to make each entity and object? <br/>
User creating their own things <br/>
-Decent tool to use <br/>
-Cross platform <br/>
You can design anywhere you want <br/>
If you want data communication, programming is therefore used <br/>
-Unity <br/>
Virtual env -> Server -> Robot <br/>

## Metaverse =/= Unity Programming 

## Turtlebot
Turtlebot3 Burger <br/>
-Small-scaled robot <br/>

## Virtual Space-Turtlebot Integration
Synchronize robot with virtual environment <br/>

## Objective of this Course
Make this robot run <br/>

## Experiment Converage
Turtlebot3 Burger Experiment <br/>

## Metaverse?
Failure <br/>

## There we go? 
Factory, making new cars <br/>
Regenerated BMW factory made by Nvidia <br/>
Unity created this as well <br/>

## Metaverse is not your social network 
Platform, not like a social network, but there are some approaches <br/>
-> Covid-19 this in down <br/>
Approached as a social network platform <br/>
-> Found out that it does not generate any interests in terms of profit-wise <br/>
-Meta vision is not coming yet, but they are not wrong <br/>
