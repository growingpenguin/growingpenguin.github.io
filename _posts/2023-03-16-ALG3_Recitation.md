In-Place Algorithm <br/>
: An algorithm that does not need extra space and produces an output in the same memory that contains the data by transforming the input 'in-place'. <br/>
However a small constant extra space used for variables are allowed. <br/>
Usually this space is O(log n), though sometimes O(n) is allowed.<br/>
Examples<br/>
In-Place: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort <br/>
Not In-Place: Merge Sort(It requires O(n) extra space) <br/>
Quick Sort? <br/>
: Uses extra space for recursive function calls. It is not used to manipulate input, but only for recursive calls. <br/>
