# Foundations of US Constitution
Paragraph1 <br/>
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one person to dissolve political bands which have connected them with another and to 
assume among power's of Earth, the seperate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes to seperation. <br/>
The people of the US believe that all people are created equal and have certain natural rights(life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). <br/>
The government of Great Britain has violated these rights (Refusing to approve useful laws, interfering with the rightful lawmaking of individual states, and taking away people's property without due process of law.)
Because of these violations, the people of the US have no choice but to dissolve their political ties with Great Britain and form their own independent nation <br/>
=> The people of the U.S. are breaking away from Great Britain because Great Britain has been treating them unfairly. <br/>
They have certain rights that Great Britain has been violating and tired of it.<br/>
