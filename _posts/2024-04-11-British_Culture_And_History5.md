# An English Village Hollowed Out for a Train That May Never Come
## Words
**hollowed out** <br/>
Process of removing the core or the most significant parts <br/>
Likely refers to the process of removing the core or the most significant parts of the village, possibly including its residents, homes, and businesses <br/>
**tranquility** <br/>
A state of peace and calm <br/>
When describing the large villas at Whitmore Heath, "tranquility" suggests that these homes offer a serene and quiet living environment, away from the noise and bustle typically found in urban areas <br/>
**striking** <br/>
Within easy reach or a short distance away, particularly in a context where no significant effort is required to travel from one place to another <br/>
Here, it indicates that while the villas provide the calm of the countryside, they are also conveniently located near urban centers like Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford <br/>
**padlocked** <br/>
Gates that have been secured with a padlock, a portable locking device that is typically used to prevent unauthorized access <br/>
By mentioning that gates are padlocked, the text implies that the properties are securely closed off to protect against intrusion, emphasizing a concern for security and privacy <br/>
**trespassers** <br/>
Individuals who enter property without permission <br/>
The term specifically refers to those who intrude on someone else's land or premises without the right or consent of the owner <br/>
The warning signs for trespassers, coupled with the mention of CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) security monitoring, indicate that these properties have taken measures to discourage unauthorized entry and to monitor any such attempts <br/>
**dumpster** <br/>
A large metal container designed for storing and disposing of waste <br/>
A dumpster filled with waste standing outside a house suggests that there might be ongoing construction, renovation, or a major cleaning operation, leading to the accumulation of waste materials that need to be disposed of <br/>
**carpeted**: <br/>
Typically, "carpeted" refers to a floor that has been covered with carpet <br/>
However, in this context, the term is used metaphorically to describe the roof of a house being completely covered by something else, in this case, moss <br/>
It implies that the moss is so thick or widespread across the roof's surface that it resembles a carpet <br/>
**veneer**: <br/>
Usually refers to a thin layer of superior wood or material that is adhered to the surface of inferior wood, making it appear more attractive <br/>
"veneer of moss" metaphorically describes the layer of moss on the roof as if it were a thin, decorative layer, emphasizing the complete and uniform coverage that resembles the application of a veneer <br/>
**moss**: <br/>
A small, green, non-vascular plant that typically grows in dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations <br/>
The "veneer of moss" on the roof suggests that the house might be in a moist environment or that the roof has been neglected, allowing the moss to grow extensively <br/>
**byproduct**: <br/>
Something produced as a secondary or incidental result of another process <br/>
In this context, the scene of abandonment (including the empty and neglected properties) is described as a byproduct of a large-scale rail project <br/>
This implies that the abandonment and neglect weren't the main goals of the rail project but rather unintended outcomes that occurred as a result of its planning and execution <br/>
**case study**: <br/>
A detailed examination of a particular instance or event, especially as a model of analysis <br/>
The rail project is described as a case study in the problems Britain faces when planning large-scale infrastructure, suggesting it serves as an example or illustration of broader issues within such processes, including planning, execution, and impact <br/>
**infrastructure**: <br/>
Basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society or enterprise, such as transportation systems, communication networks, and utilities <br/>
The term "large-scale infrastructure" in this context refers to major projects like the rail project, which are significant in scope and intended to serve as foundational components of a region's or country's overall functionality <br/>
**scarring**: <br/>
Lasting damage or negative impact <br/>
The "scarring that remains" alludes to the long-term, visible effects of the rail project that have negatively impacted the community or environment, such as the abandonment and neglect of properties <br/>
It implies that these effects are both significant and enduring <br/>
**awry**: <br/>
Going awry means deviating from the intended or expected course, leading to unfavorable or negative outcomes <br/>
When the text mentions projects going awry, it refers to the rail project not proceeding as planned or expected, resulting in unintended consequences like the described scene of abandonment <br/>
This term highlights the discrepancy between the project's goals and its actual outcomes <br/>
**modest** <br/>
Homes that are likely smaller, less expensive, or simpler in terms of their architecture and amenities <br/>
The use of "modest" to describe homes in the nearby area of Madeley suggests that these properties are more affordable or unassuming compared to potentially larger or more luxurious homes elsewhere <br/>
**thriving** <br/>
Describe a condition of flourishing, prospering, or doing very well <br/>
When the speaker says the area "was thriving with young families," it implies that the community was once vibrant, full of life, and possibly growing, with many young families living there, contributing to a dynamic and lively environment <br/>
**ministers**: <br/>
Government officials or heads of particular departments within the government <br/>
The reference to "six prime ministers" indicates that the rail project has spanned a long time, affecting or involving the administrations of six different prime ministers <br/>
**spurring**: <br/> 
To stimulate, encourage, or promote <br/> 
It's used to describe the expected positive effect of the High Speed 2 (HS2) train line on economic development <br/> 
The idea is that by providing faster connections between major cities, the train line would act as a catalyst for economic growth, potentially leading to more jobs, better connectivity, and enhanced overall economic activity in the regions it serves <br/> 
**overburden**: <br/>
Refers to something that is carrying a load or burden greater than its capacity, causing strain or stress <br/>
In the context of the mainline rail network, it suggests that the existing rail infrastructure is struggling to accommodate the current demand for rail services <br/>
This could be due to a variety of factors, such as too many trains running on limited tracks, outdated systems that can't handle the volume of passengers, or physical wear on the infrastructure <br/>
The promise of HS2 to liberate space for more local services implies that by diverting some of the long-distance travel to the new high-speed line, it would relieve pressure on the existing network, thereby improving service quality or capacity for local and regional trains <br/>
**government-financed**: <br/>
Something that is funded or paid for by the government <br/>
In this case, it specifies that the company responsible for developing the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project is financed by government funds, meaning the financial resources required for the project's development come from the government's budget <br/>
**locals**: <br/>
The people living in the area affected by the HS2 project <br/>
These are the residents or community members who are directly impacted by the construction and development activities associated with the rail line <br/>
**impending**: <br/>
About to happen or forthcoming <br/>
The use of "impending" in relation to the construction suggests that the start of the HS2 project's development was imminent, creating a sense of urgency or concern among the locals <br/>
**bought out**: <br/> 
To receive a payment in exchange for leaving or relinquishing one's property <br/> 
In this context, some residents campaigned to be bought out, meaning they sought financial compensation from the government or the responsible company in exchange for their property and agreeing to move away, due to concerns or objections over the construction of the HS2 <br/> 
**eminent domain**: <br/>
A legal power that allows governments or their agents to acquire private property for public use, with compensation provided to the property owner <br/>
The term indicates that the company developing HS2 also utilized this authority to compulsorily acquire land needed for the project, regardless of whether the property owners were willing to sell voluntarily <br/>
