# Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation
## Overview
Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation <br/>
Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation provides NVIDIA hardware-accelerated packages for depth segmentation <br/>
-The isaac_ros_bi3d package uses the optimized Bi3D DNN model to perform stereo-depth estimation via binary classification, which is used for depth segmentation <br/>
-Depth segmentation can be used to determine whether an obstacle is within a proximity field and to avoid collisions with obstacles during navigation <br/>
![Compression10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5f3fed4d-12b2-4157-9eb9-e982b4645e4b) <br/>
-Bi3D is used in a graph of nodes to provide depth segmentation from a time-synchronized input left and right stereo image pair <br/>
-Images to Bi3D need to be rectified and resized to the appropriate input resolution. The aspect ratio of the image needs to be maintained; <br/>
hence, a crop and resize may be required to maintain the input aspect ratio <br/>
-The graph for DNN encode, to DNN inference, to DNN decode is part of the Bi3D node <br/>
Inference is performed using TensorRT, as the Bi3D DNN model is designed to use optimizations supported by TensorRT <br/>
-Compared to other stereo disparity functions, depth segmentation provides a prediction of whether an obstacle is within a proximity field, as opposed to continuous depth <br/>
while simultaneously predicting freespace from the ground plane, which other functions typically do not provide <br/>
-Also unlike other stereo disparity functions in Isaac ROS, depth segmentation runs on NVIDIA DLA(deep learning accelerator) <br/>
which is separate and independent from the GPU

## Isaac ROS NITROS Acceleration
Package is powered by NVIDIA Isaac Transport for ROS (NITROS) <br/>
Which leverages type adaptation and negotiation to optimize message formats and dramatically accelerate communication between participating nodes <br/>
## Packages
isaac_ros_bi3d <br/>
## Supported Platforms
Package is designed and tested to be compatible with ROS 2 Humble running on Jetson or an x86_64 system with an NVIDIA GPU <br/>
## Docker
Strongly recommend leveraging the Isaac ROS Dev Docker images by following these steps <br/>
This will streamline your development environment setup with the correct versions of dependencies on both Jetson and x86_64 platforms <br/>
