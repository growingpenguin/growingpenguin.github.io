# Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation
## Overview
Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation <br/>
Isaac ROS Depth Segmentation provides NVIDIA hardware-accelerated packages for depth segmentation <br/>
-The isaac_ros_bi3d package uses the optimized Bi3D DNN model to perform stereo-depth estimation via binary classification, which is used for depth segmentation <br/>
-Depth segmentation can be used to determine whether an obstacle is within a proximity field and to avoid collisions with obstacles during navigation <br/>
