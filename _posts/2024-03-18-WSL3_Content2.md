## Prof Notes
### Paragraph2
-Senses can add context to any kind of information <br/>
Seeing and Reading <br/>
Affect how you perceive info <br/>
-Not physically there when people happening <br/>
-Mass media impersonal <br/>
Some interactive like radio postcast, but most of the time indirect <br/>
Context of what happening, feedback is delayed, one way information <br/>
-Example: <br/>
Not want favorite show cancelled <br/>
=> Mostly one way <br/>
### Paragraph3: Functions of Mass Media
What does Mass Media accomplish? <br/>
**Information Function** <br/>

Explosion of information <br/>
-Competing, leading to inaccuracy <br/>
**Interpretation function** <br/>
-Newpaper editorial <br/>
Write column > Opinion going on <br/>
Think not know what talking bias, lack of trust <br/>
Example: Fox News, ommit info, focus on idiotic news <br/>
-Pretending to be neutral <br/>
Lying to the audience in a regular basis <br/>
-Manipulate deceive people on purpose <br/>
propoganda: lie, and benefit from it <br/>
Not, bad, sometimes it helps <br/>
**Instruction function** <br/>
Intructive: more like teaching <br/>
In-depth coverage <br/>
ex. lengthy interview  <br/>
Opposite to television <br/>
-Ex. Documentary <br/>
**Bonding Function** <br/>
Coming together as a community <br/>
Talk about the news with other people <br/>
Lots of time tragic events <br/>
Whole country bonded together in shock <br/>

**Diversion Function** <br/>
Diversion: Go off, diverted from <br/>
Light, enjoyable, diversion from every day life <br/>
**The Media as GateKeeper** <br/>
GateKeeper: Let you into a gate or not <br/>
Media outlets are affection or control info that we get <br/>
Decisions are made in the organization <br/>
-relating info <br/>
-limiting: Executive, no we are not reporting, for whatever reason <br/>

-These days, technology is needed to access <br/>
**Limiting** <br/>
Decision made > Which part of the story gets reported <br/>
Ex. Newspaper <br/>
Subscription & Advertising commercials <br/>
Limitation is not irrelevant, not fit into the narrative <br/>
-Time constraints, pressure from advertisers <br/>
-censorship <br/>
Governments sensor the news, everyone are human beings <br/>
We can't help, we have our biases <br/>
-As long as upfront of biases, leftest or liberal, as long as we know is ok, but pretending to be objective, it is a problem for society <br/>
Not locked <br/>
-Some people, don't listen to anybody, more rigid in those beliefs <br/>
Expand messages <br/>
News story on television, about a natural disaster, next day cite the story, expanding on the information <br/>
Fact-check <br/>
Politions exaggerate, don't tell the truth <br/>
Gatekeeper reinterpretation <br/>
Reinterpreation, lot's of things we don't know.. <br/>
Tune into business channels, break it down, help you understand the materials <br/>

**The Media as "Watchdog"** <br/>
No independent media <br/>
NOrth Korea, Hostage video, not real <br/>
Other countries nominally democratic, media has a role <br/>
US: Freedom of Press <br/>
Somebody has to help people from going on <br/>
Investigative reporting <br/>
Research > Background > Get info out of them <br/>
Expose info > motivate people to advocate some type of change <br/>
Sometimes it doesn't happen <br/>
Covering president & Whitehouse <br/>
Watch dog < Lap dog <br/>
-Abandon watchdog responsibility <br/>
Government giving information > Reported as if true <br/>
-Attack-dog not helpful <br/>
To get more clicks, or views, not helpful <br/>
Too much, some of them just don't trust anybody <br/>
