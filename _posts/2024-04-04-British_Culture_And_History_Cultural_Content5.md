## Words

**aspen** <br/> 
A type of tree known for its trembling leaves which flutter in even the slightest breeze <br/> 
**glades** <br/> 
A glade is a clearing within a forest <br/> 
It's an open, often grassy space surrounded by woods or dense foliage <br/> 
**tipsters** <br/>
Individuals who offer advice or recommendations <br/>
These are people who are sharing their personal recommendations for spring walks or hikes based on their experiences <br/>
**prologue** <br/>
An introductory section of a work of literature <br/>
It might provide background information, set the scene for the story that follows, or otherwise introduce themes, characters, or the setting <br/>
Describing something as one of the "great prologues of literature" suggests it's widely recognized for its quality, importance, or effectiveness in setting up the narrative <br/>
**seeping** <br/>
The slow passage of a liquid through a porous material or the gradual emergence of liquid through small openings <br/>
In a literal sense, it might describe water or moisture moving slowly through the ground or emerging at the surface, often creating wet, marshy, or boggy conditions <br/>
In the context of literature, describing a bank as "seeping" suggests a very vivid, damp, and possibly fertile setting, which could be symbolic or significant within the narratives of these works <br/>
**"bank** <br/>
The side of a river or stream, often sloped and sometimes covered in vegetation <br/>
The term "seeping" suggests that this particular bank is wet, possibly due to water seeping out of the ground or from the nearby water body itself, making the soil moist or marshy <br/> 
**where the infant was dropped from a cart** <br/>
An anecdote from this book, symbolically marking a location associated with his early life <br/>
**As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning** <br/>
Second book in Lee's autobiographical series, detailing his departure from his home village as an adolescent to embark on a journey that eventually leads him to Spain <br/>
The phrase "where the adolescent loped off to Spain" indicates that the walk also starts from a location associated with this departure, marking a transition point in Lee's life and literary narrative <br/>
**circular Laurie Lee walk** <br/>
Landmarks and landscapes that were significant to Laurie Lee's life and works, offering participants a way to physically engage with the settings of his stories <br/>
**loped off** <br/>
A casual or leisurely departure, with a sense of purpose <br/>
To "lope" means to move or run with a long, bounding stride, often suggesting an easy, relaxed pace rather than a hurried or frantic one <br/>
So, when it's said that the adolescent "loped off to Spain," it suggests that Laurie Lee embarked on his journey to Spain with a sense of adventure and perhaps a carefree attitude, moving away from his familiar surroundings in pursuit of new experiences <br/>
**bounded**: <br/>
Enclosed or edged <br/>
When it mentions "primrose-bounded paths," it's describing walking paths that are edged or lined with primroses, creating a visual and possibly aromatic border that enhances the scenic beauty of the walk <br/>
**serenaded** <br/>
To be entertained or soothed with music <br/> "Skylark-serenaded pasture" thus describes a pasture (a field where grass is grown for animals to graze) where one can hear the singing of skylarks. It's a poetic way of saying that the natural sounds of skylarks singing embellish the experience of being in the pasture, making it more enjoyable and atmospheric.
