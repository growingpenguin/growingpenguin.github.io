**prologue** <br/>
An introductory section of a work of literature <br/>
It might provide background information, set the scene for the story that follows, or otherwise introduce themes, characters, or the setting <br/>
Describing something as one of the "great prologues of literature" suggests it's widely recognized for its quality, importance, or effectiveness in setting up the narrative <br/>
**seeping** <br/>
The slow passage of a liquid through a porous material or the gradual emergence of liquid through small openings <br/>
In a literal sense, it might describe water or moisture moving slowly through the ground or emerging at the surface, often creating wet, marshy, or boggy conditions <br/>
In the context of literature, describing a bank as "seeping" suggests a very vivid, damp, and possibly fertile setting, which could be symbolic or significant within the narratives of these works <br/>
**"bank** <br/>
The side of a river or stream, often sloped and sometimes covered in vegetation <br/>
The term "seeping" suggests that this particular bank is wet, possibly due to water seeping out of the ground or from the nearby water body itself, making the soil moist or marshy <br/> 
**where the infant was dropped from a cart** <br/>
An anecdote from this book, symbolically marking a location associated with his early life <br/>
**As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning** <br/>
Second book in Lee's autobiographical series, detailing his departure from his home village as an adolescent to embark on a journey that eventually leads him to Spain <br/>

Landmarks and landscapes that were significant to Laurie Lee's life and works, offering participants a way to physically engage with the settings of his stories <br/>
**loped off** <br/>
A casual or leisurely departure, with a sense of purpose <br/>
To "lope" means to move or run with a long, bounding stride, often suggesting an easy, relaxed pace rather than a hurried or frantic one <br/>
So, when it's said that the adolescent "loped off to Spain," it suggests that Laurie Lee embarked on his journey to Spain with a sense of adventure and perhaps a carefree attitude, moving away from his familiar surroundings in pursuit of new experiences <br/>
**bounded**: <br/>
Enclosed or edged <br/>
When it mentions "primrose-bounded paths," it's describing walking paths that are edged or lined with primroses, creating a visual and possibly aromatic border that enhances the scenic beauty of the walk <br/>
**serenaded** <br/>
To be entertained or soothed with music <br/> "Skylark-serenaded pasture" thus describes a pasture (a field where grass is grown for animals to graze) where one can hear the singing of skylarks <br/>
It's a poetic way of saying that the natural sounds of skylarks singing embellish the experience of being in the pasture, making it more enjoyable and atmospheric <br/>
**pasture** <br/>
A field of grass where animals graze <br/>
In the wider context of a scenic walk, a pasture represents an open, tranquil space, often contributing to the pastoral beauty of the landscape <br/>
**clinging**: <br/>
Here, "clinging" is used to describe the manner in which beech trees are growing on a slope <br/>

**ramble**: <br/>
A long, leisurely walk in the countryside, often without a specific route or destination in mind <br/>

However, in this context, "The ramble" likely refers to a specific walking route or path designed for people to enjoy the scenery and possibly other features, such as wildlife or historical sites <br/>
**punctuated**: <br/>
In writing, "punctuated" is used to describe something interrupted or emphasized at intervals <br/>
When referring to a walk or ramble, "punctuated" means that the journey is marked by distinct points or features at regular intervals <br/>
These points break up the walk, adding interest or variety to the experience <br/>
**inscribed**: <br/>
To inscribe something means to write, carve, or etch words onto a surface <br/>
In this sentence, "posts inscribed with poetry" means that there are posts along the ramble that have poetry written on them <br/>
The poetry is permanently part of these posts, allowing walkers to read and enjoy the verses as they pass by <br/>
**posts** <br/>
Physical markers or signposts placed along the ramble or walking path <br/>
These are likely upright structures made of wood, metal, or another durable material, designed to stand out to walkers <br/>
The posts serve a specific purpose here: they are "inscribed with poetry by the valley’s most celebrated son," meaning that each post carries verses or lines of poetry written on it <br/>
**coastal** <br/>

**channels**: <br/>

In a coastal context, mentioning a beach that "faces the channel" likely refers to a beach overlooking a narrow stretch of water between two land masses or within a larger body of water <br/>
This channel could be a natural part of the coastline, offering unique scenic views or influencing the types of marine life and debris that are washed ashore <br/>
**Mermaids’ purses**: <br/>
A colloquial term for the egg cases of certain species of sharks, skates, and rays <br/>
These egg cases are often leathery and rectangular with pointy horns or tendrils at the corners, which can help them attach to underwater objects <br/>
After the young sea creature has hatched and left the case, these egg cases sometimes wash up on beaches <br/>
They are considered "treasures" because they are interesting natural objects that provide insight into the marine life off the coast <br/>
Finding a mermaid's purse on a beach can be an exciting discovery, indicating the presence of these marine species in the nearby waters <br/>
**recalling**: <br/>
Bringing to mind or commemorating something from the past <br/>
