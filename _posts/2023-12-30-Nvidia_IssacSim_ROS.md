# Nvidia Issac Sim 
NVIDIA Omniverse™ Isaac Sim : Robotics simulation toolkit for the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform <br/>
-Has essential features for building virtual robotic worlds and experiments <br/>
-Provides researchers and practitioners with the tools and workflows they need to create robust, physically accurate simulations and synthetic datasets  <br/>
Robust Simulations: <br/>
Isaac Sim is built to provide highly realistic simulations of robots and their environments. This includes accurate physics modeling, which is crucial for ensuring that a robot's behavior in the simulation closely matches how it would act in the real world  <br/>
Synthetic Datasets: <br/>
For AI and machine learning, large amounts of data are required. Isaac Sim can generate synthetic datasets, which are artificially created data sets that mimic real-world data. These datasets are particularly useful for training ml models when real-world data is scarce, expensive, or difficult to obtain.  <br/>
-Supports navigation and manipulation applications through ROS/ROS2. It simulates sensor data from sensors such as RGB-D, Lidar, and IMU for various computer vision techniques such as domain randomization, ground-truth labeling, segmentation, and bounding boxes <br/>
ROS/ROS2 Integration: <br/>
ROS & ROS2 are widely used frameworks in robotics for building robot software. Isaac Sim supports integration with ROS/ROS2, allowing for easier development and testing of navigation and manipulation tasks, which are common in robotics applications. <br/>
