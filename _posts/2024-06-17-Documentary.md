# Documentary
## Introduction
Roots <br/>
Docere: To teach or instruct <br/>
Document: A modern phrase indicating important piece of paper presented in court <br/>
To document: Say we document its identity or statements <br/>
When was 'documentary' first used? <br/>
First used by John Grierson who was writing about the film Moana(1926) <br/>
=> Said it has documentary value <br/>
<br/>
John Grierson, the founder of the British documentary movement in the 1930s <br/>
**Documentary**: Creative treatment of actuality <br/>
Surprise to students that even this time, creativity was underlined <br/>
<br/>
Film cannot be qualified or disqualified by a single criterion <br/>
Example: <br/>
Often considered actors belong to fictional films and not to true documentraries <br/>
There is an exception <br/>
A Tv-documentary using professional actors to re-enact a crime scene in order to make us understand how things may have happened <br/>
Immoral to have the real criminal to perform another knife stabbing to the victim,, event though it may be more true or closer to the original one <br/>

## Possible modes or narrative strategies of documentaries 
**Expository** <br/>
Lecturing, for example with a personal presenter or voice-over <br/>
Ex.Trader <br/>
Why should.. get a job <br/>
What do you want to be in the future.. kid replying <br/>
**Observational** <br/>
The camera, microphone, and film crew seem not to be disturbing the scene or even noticed by the participants <br/>
Like "fly on the wall" <br/>
Ex.Trader <br/>
Trader falls into this category, as there is no interference of what is going on, and mostly the film crew stay out of the film <br/>
**Participatory or Interactive** <br/>
The film crew takes part in the action or chain of events <br/>
=> Used a lot in today's documentaries <br/>
**Reflexive** <br/>
Film exposes and discusses its own role as a film (e.g. ethics or conditions of film making ) alongside the treatment of case or subject <br/>
**Performative** <br/>
The film crew creates many of the events and situations to be filmed by their own intervention or through the events carried out for the sake of them <br/>
Example: <br/>
Objective to criticize Mc Donalds <br/>
Conduct an experiment: <br/>
For one month, I am going to eat nothing but McDonalds (Othr person: Didn't eat the same thing) <br/>
Starts getting sick, gains a lot of weight, before and after <br/>
**Poetic** <br/>
The aesthetic values, the qualities of the form and sensual appeals are dominant <br/>
Ex.Trader <br/>
Techniques, landscape, country that nobody thinks about <br/>
Contain music, help find the mood going on  <br/>

## More points to consider
**Intentions of the filmmaker** <br/>
Enthusiasm and commitment, the filmmaker wants to explore, to probe, and to show us something important or otherwise overlooked; devoted to a cause or to people, trying to make a difference <br/>
**Subject matter, themes or content** <br/>
Something of importance and relevance; historical, social or natural phenomena; persons or places of significance <br/>
**Expectations of the (general) audience** <br/>
Authenticity, insight, disclosure, something about real people and problems, learning something <br/>
**Target groups (implied)** <br/>
The general public(public service) or segments with a more specialized interest and knowledge on the subject in question <br/>
**Ethics** <br/>
We expect truthfulness, not propoganda <br/>
The documentary may be engaged and enthusiastic, but should be open about its preferences, sympathies, and presuppositions <br/>
"Neutrality" or "Objectivity" should be understood as problematic, but a well-balanced view is welcomed <br/>
**Communicative Function** <br/>
To inform, discuss, engage, enlighten, intervene, explore, express, disturb and commit - more so than to merely entertain, amuse, distract, conform or confim <br/>
**Context of actual use** <br/>
Education, public service, debate forum, campaigns, discussions and pastime entertainment <br/>
**Style and form** <br/>
Often realism, perhaps with a reportage-like style, interviews, a rough style, lighting and settings and sound appear natural and not carefully controlled <br/>
Often an argumentative, exploring, or investigative attitude <br/>
**Relating to major genres of art** <br/>
It is not fiction. It may be highly artistic and poetic, but seems more like art with purpose than art for art's own sake <br/>
Epics, lyrics, and drama seems to serve didactic[educational and instructive]aspect <br/>
**Recordings** <br/>
On location, authentic settings and props, real time, real sound, no actors or acting, but actual people(or animals, in nature documentaries) being themselves <br/>
Drama and narrative appear not imposed on the scenes, but emerging from actual events <br/>
**Importance and evaluation** <br/>
In terms of context and communicative qualities, the film makes a considerable contribution towards a better world <br/>
