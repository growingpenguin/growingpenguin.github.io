# Mask R-CNN
## Abstract
Simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation <br/> 
1) Detects objects efficiently in an image <br/>
2) Generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance simultaneously <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN method extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask <br/> 
 Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks <br/>
e.g. Allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework <br/>
-Show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges <br/>
Including instance segmentation, bounding box object detection, and person key point detection <br/>
-Mask R-CNN out performs all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners <br/>
We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition <br/>

Footnote: <br/>
**Object Instance Segmentation**: Smart tool that can look at this picture and do two main things <br/>
-Find and Outline Each Object: <br/>
Identifies each item in the picture <br/>
Ex. Can spot where each car, person, or animal is <br/>
Then, it draws a line around each one, kind of like tracing their shape so you can clearly see them as separate things <br/>
-Tell Similar Objects Apart: <br/>
Bit like naming each item <br/>
If there are several items of the same type, like three cars, it doesn't just say "these are cars." <br/>
Goes further and says "This is car 1, this is car 2, and this is car 3." <br/>
It can tell each car apart, even though they are all cars <br/>
**segmentation mask**: <br/>
Technique used to divide an image into multiple parts, or segments <br/>
-Goal of segmentation: <br/>
Simplify or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze <br/>
**overhead**: <br/>
Often refers to extra processing power, memory, or time required to perform a particular task <br/>
**pose estimation**: <br/>
Not just detecting the presence of a person in the image, but also understanding the spatial arrangement by identifying key body points <br/>
**COCO Suite of Challenges**: <br/>
Well-known benchmarking platform in the field of computer vision <br/>
Provides a set of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics for comparing the performance of various algorithms and models in different tasks related to image understanding and object detection <br/>
**Single model entry** <br/>
Single unified model is used to perform and be evaluated across multiple tasks or problem domains <br/>
