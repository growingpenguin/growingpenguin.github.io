# Mask R-CNN
## Abstract
Simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation <br/> 
1) Detects objects efficiently in an image <br/>
2) Generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance simultaneously <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN method extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask <br/> 
 Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks <br/>
e.g. Allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework <br/>
-Show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges <br/>
Including instance segmentation, bounding box object detection, and person key point detection <br/>
-Mask R-CNN out performs all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners <br/>
We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition <br/>

**Object Instance Segmentation**: Smart tool that can look at this picture and do two main things <br/>
-Find and Outline Each Object: <br/>
Identifies each item in the picture <br/>
Ex. Can spot where each car, person, or animal is <br/>
Then, it draws a line around each one, kind of like tracing their shape so you can clearly see them as separate things <br/>
-Tell Similar Objects Apart: <br/>
Bit like naming each item <br/>
If there are several items of the same type, like three cars, it doesn't just say "these are cars." <br/>
Goes further and says "This is car 1, this is car 2, and this is car 3." <br/>
It can tell each car apart, even though they are all cars <br/>
**segmentation mask**: <br/>
Technique used to divide an image into multiple parts, or segments <br/>
-Goal of segmentation: <br/>
Simplify or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze <br/>
**overhead**: <br/>
Often refers to extra processing power, memory, or time required to perform a particular task <br/>
**pose estimation**: <br/>
Not just detecting the presence of a person in the image, but also understanding the spatial arrangement by identifying key body points <br/>
**COCO Suite of Challenges**: <br/>
Well-known benchmarking platform in the field of computer vision <br/>
Provides a set of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics for comparing the performance of various algorithms and models in different tasks related to image understanding and object detection <br/>
**Single model entry** <br/>
Single unified model is used to perform and be evaluated across multiple tasks or problem domains <br/> 
## 1.Introduction
Vision community has rapidly improved object detection and semantic segmentation results over a short period of time <br/>  
-Advances have been driven by powerful baseline systems, such as the Fast/Faster RCNN and Fully Convolutional Network(FCN) (Respectively, frameworks for object detection and semantic segmentation) <br/> 








These methods are conceptually intuitive and offer flexibility and robustness, together with fast training and inference time. Our goal in this work is to develop a
comparably enabling framework for instance segmentation.
Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires
the correct detection of all objects in an image while also
precisely segmenting each instance. It therefore combines
elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semant

**Object Detection** <br/>
:Computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video <br/>
This process not only classifies what objects are present in an image but also provides their precise location <br/>
-How It Works?:  <br/>
Typically, this is done by drawing bounding boxes around each detected object and labeling them with the appropriate class (like "dog", "car", etc.) <br/>
Applications: Object detection is used in various applications, such as in surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, image retrieval systems, and more.
**Semantic Segmentation**: <br/>
:More detailed approach where every pixel in an image is classified as belonging to a particular class or category <br/>
Semantic segmentation classifies each pixel, resulting in a pixel-wise map of the image <br/>
(Unlike object detection, which identifies objects as a whole) <br/>
How It Works:  <br/>
Ex. In an image of a street scene, semantic segmentation would label every pixel as belonging to categories  <br/>
Like "road", "pedestrian", "vehicle", "building", etc <br/>
-Results in a segmented map of the image where each segment corresponds to a different class.
Applications:  <br/>
Widely used in medical imaging (like segmenting different types of tissues in an MRI scan) <br/>
self-driving cars (for understanding road scenes at a detailed level) <br/>
agricultural automation (like identifying different plants and weeds) <br/>
**Fast R-CNN**: <br/>
Improved version of the original R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) <br/>
Fast R-CNN enhanced the speed and efficiency of object detection by using a single-stage training algorithm that jointly learns to classify object proposals and refine their spatial locations. It also introduced the use of ROI (Region of Interest) pooling to extract features from these proposals efficiently <br/>
**Faster R-CNN**: <br/>
Building upon Fast R-CNN, the Faster R-CNN introduced the concept of a Region Proposal Network (RPN). This network is a fully convolutional network that efficiently generates high-quality region proposals, which are then used by Fast R-CNN for detection. The integration of RPN significantly improved the speed (hence "Faster") and accuracy of object detection <br/>
**Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)**: <br/>
FCN for Semantic Segmentation: <br/>
The Fully Convolutional Network is a type of neural network architecture that is designed specifically for semantic segmentation. Unlike traditional CNNs that are designed for classification and output a single prediction per image, FCNs output a pixel-wise prediction, which makes them suitable for semantic segmentation tasks.
Impact of FCN: <br/>
FCNs can take input of any size and produce correspondingly-sized output. This is achieved by replacing the fully connected layers in standard CNNs with convolutional layers, allowing the network to make dense predictions for per-pixel tasks. The development of FCNs marked a significant advance in the ability to perform detailed segmentation of images, which is crucial for various applications like medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more <br/>
