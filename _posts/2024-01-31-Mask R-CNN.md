# Mask R-CNN
## Abstract
Simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation <br/> 
Approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance <br/> 
-Mask R-CNN method extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask <br/>

Footnote: <br/>
**Object Instance Segmentation**: Smart tool that can look at this picture and do two main things <br/>
-Find and Outline Each Object: <br/>
Identifies each item in the picture <br/>
Ex.Can spot where each car, person, or animal is. Then, it draws a line around each one, kind of like tracing their shape so you can clearly see them as separate things <br/>
-Tell Similar Objects Apart: <br/>
Bit like naming each item <br/>
If there are several items of the same type, like three cars, it doesn't just say "these are cars." <br/>
It goes further and says "this is car 1, this is car 2, and this is car 3." <br/>
It can tell each car apart, even though they are all cars <br/>
**segmentation mask**: <br/>
Technique used to divide an image into multiple parts, or segments <br/>
-Goal of segmentation: <br/>
Simplify or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze <br/>
