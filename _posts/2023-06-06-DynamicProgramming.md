# Dynamic Programming # 
Three main items <br/>
guess, recursion, and memoization <br/>
Memoization: <br/>
When subproblems are solved, save the values in the DP table and when the same problem come out, use the value stored in the DP table without calculating the same problem again<br/>
Process <br/>
1.Define subproblems <br/>
2.Guess your possible choices <br/>
3.Ideate subproblems <br/>
4.Apply recursion and memoization <br/>
5.Solve the original problem <br/>
<br/>
Concept of Dynamic Programming <br/>
(1) Able to divide the large problem to small subproblems <br/>
(2) Subprobs should be repeated and these subprobs should have the same results <br/>
(3) Subprobs should be stored in a DP table after a single calculation. When reused, use the DP table. The process is called memoization 
(4) Dynamic programming can be implemented either by Top-down or Bottom-up approach<br/>
Top-down: Analyze the problem from the top to the bottom. Commonly uses recursion <br/>
-Is easy to understand <br/>
Bottom-Up: Analyze the problem
-Expand the problem to a larger problem starting from the smallest problem. Loops are commonly used. <br/>

**Typical Examples**<br/>
2.1.Fibonacci <br/>
 <br/>
2.2. Bellmanford <br/>
<br/>
2.3. KnapSack <br/>
