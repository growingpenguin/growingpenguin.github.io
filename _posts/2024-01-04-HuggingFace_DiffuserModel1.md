# Collective Intelligence & Creative AI
## Introduction
-Diffusion models are popular for generating things <br/>
-Many people excited, but not too many people are taking ownership and start building on it <br/>
-Course designed to introduce ideas to get you up running specifically on using the diffusers library. <br/>
More generally trying to understand different concepts from the basics all the way up to something like stable diffusion <br/>
By taking it, fine-tuning it, adapting it, and really understanding all of the pieces that go into the some big complex system like this <br/>

## Collective Intelligence and Creative AI 
by David Ha, Stability AI <br/>
-General talk about Generative AI <br/>
-Understanding collective intelligence or how people collectively use might help us develop a framework for  <br/>
understanding how texture image models or more broadly AI tool augments human's creative expression and help us understand why things are really taking off this year <br/>
-Two core of what's happening in the open-source community <br/>
Hand large-structured models designed to do things very well or on the other hand open source models or hacking models, taking them apart and making things out of them <br/>
Image generation from collective intelligence <br/>
ex. GAN(Generative Adversial Network) or VAE(Variational Auto Encoder) or Stable Diffusion <br/>
-Image generation experiments using humans on algorithms as reddits <br/>
Collective intelligence applied for image generation <br/>
(1)Set up a 1000 X 1000 pixel canvas(Million pixels) <br/>
(2)Each reddit users is allowed to draw just one pixel every 5 minutes, and experiments last for a week <br/>
User space has million times 256 possible color possibilites, so having a wide range exploration space <br/>
From user's point of view, user can share and collaborate with other users and network dynamics can also effect what is drawn  <br/>
Three properties: <br/>
Exploration space, Drive to share and act on the environments, Feedback from the complex network in this million pixel canvus <br/>
Users on Reddit without any explicit reward signal, coordinate strategy on Reddit discussion forum to defend some design to attack other designs and deform alliances <br/>
Result: <br/>
Awesome patterns, Resilience, Robustness going on and this optimizes many things happening now in the diffusion models based in opensource creative community <br/>
