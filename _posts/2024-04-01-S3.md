# Create S3
## Create two S3 buckets
(1)S3 Bucket name: inferencefilecsv <br/>
The S3 bucket, named 'inferencefilecsv', is designated for storing 'inputfile.csv', which contains critical data for inferencing within our internal AI model focused on sloshing prediction <br/>
This repository acts as a pivotal point in our workflow, feeding the AI model with the necessary information to perform its predictive analysis. <br/>

(2)S3 Bucket name: inferenceresultbucket <br/>
The S3 bucket, named 'inferenceresultbucket', serves as the storage location for the output results generated by the Lambda function. These results encompass the sloshing predictions derived from processing 'inputfile.csv' through our specialized AI model dedicated to sloshing prediction. This bucket is a crucial component in our data processing chain, capturing and preserving the insights produced by our predictive analytics. <br/>
