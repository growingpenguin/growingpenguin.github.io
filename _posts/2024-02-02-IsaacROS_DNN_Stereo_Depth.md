# Isaac ROS DNN Inference
## Overview
Isaac ROS DNN Stereo Depth <br/>
:GPU-accelerated package for DNN-based stereo disparity <br/>
-Stereo disparity is calculated from a time-synchronized image pair sourced from a stereo camera and is used to produce a depth image or a point cloud for a scene <br/>
-The isaac_ros_ess package uses the ESS DNN model to perform stereo depth estimation via continuous disparity prediction <br/>
-Given a pair of stereo input images, the package generates a disparity map of the left input image <br/>

-ESS is used in a graph of nodes to provide a disparity prediction from an input left and right stereo image pair <br/>
-Images to ESS need to be rectified and resized to the appropriate input resolution <br/>
The aspect ratio of the image is recommended to be maintained, so the image may need to be cropped and resized to maintain the input aspect ratio <br/>
-The graph for DNN encode, DNN inference, and DNN decode is included in the ESS node <br/>
Inference is performed using TensorRT, as the ESS DNN model is designed with optimizations supported by TensorRT <br/>
ESS node is agnostic to the model dimension and disparity output has the same dimension as the ESS model <br/>

Footnote: <br/>
Stereo disparity: <br/>
Difference in coordinates of similar features within two stereo images <br/>
When capturing a scene from slightly different viewpoints(similar to how human eyes work), the same object will appear at different positions in the two images <br/>
This difference in position is what we call disparity <br/>
-In the context of computer vision and depth sensing, stereo disparity is a crucial concept used to infer depth information from two-dimensional images <br/>
-By analyzing the disparity between a pair of stereo images, algorithms can calculate the distance of objects from the camera, creating a depth map of the scene <br/>
The fundamental principle behind this process is triangulation, where the geometry of the camera setup and the disparity values are used to compute the depth for each point of interest <br/>
-Disparity is typically measured in pixels and can vary inversely with the object's distance from the camera; closer objects will have a larger disparity, while objects farther away will have smaller disparity <br/>
This information is foundational for numerous applications, including 3D reconstruction, autonomous vehicle navigation, and augmented reality, among others <br/>
