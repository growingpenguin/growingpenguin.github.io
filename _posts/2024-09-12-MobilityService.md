# Concept/Definition/Types of Mobility Service
## Week1 Review
Use of Ros2, Turtlebot <br/>
## Autonomous Driving
"Self"+"Driving" is difficult part <br/>
**Basic Structure** <br/>
1.Sensing, 2.Planning, 3.Actuation <br/>
Nvidia Localization, Path planning <br/>
**Why matter?** <br/>
Control the driving based on the decision made by the group of information from the vehicle <br/>
Collect info => Make the giant device drive, not easy <br/>
South Korea? <br/>
Hyundai and KIA's models are pretty much stocked up with advanced features and will prove to be a great competitor for Tesla <br/>
**Real Experience** <br/>
42dot <br/>
Car, drive, experiences.. <br/>

**Assignment** <br/>
-Please ride 42dot car/shuttle on your own and write/submit the report <br/>
-42dot free for the first time <br/>
Please submit a report with your experience and phtoto within two weeks <br/>
-Encourage to write in the perspectives of technical advancement, HMI and riding <br/>
Ex. Not there yet??? <br/>

## Definition of Mobility and Service
**Definition of Mobility** <br/>
Move, mobile.. keyword <br/>
1)Move Easily and Quickly <br/>
2)Transport physically and freely <br/>
Multiple options (Bus, subway, ..) <br/>

**Definition of Service** <br/>
1)Provide certain form of task or action <br/>
2)Can be Non-existent form
Come from serve <br/>
YOu can deal with.. <br/>
All dictionaries.. different intepretation, provide a certian form, but doesn't have to be a physical material <br>
Mobility as a service <br/>
=> We use mobility as a service = Strengthening accessibility and Convenience of Mobility <br/>
Ex.Combination of bus, subway.. also a mobility service <br/>

## Mobility-as-a-Service(MAAS) 
**MaaS** <br/>
**Beginning of MAAS** <br/>
Time goes by, term used as mobility as service 2014 <br/>
**Transportation as Service** <br/>

**Progress of Maas** <br/>
-Maas pilots with advanced integration <br/>
Build set up structure, set up own business <br/>
Make profit into businees prospectives <br/>
**Maas pilots with advanced integration and mobility packages** <br/>
Also use small state of vehicles <br/>

**Current Status of Maas** <br/>
-MaaS Industry size <br/>
Connectivity & IOT <br/>
Each device as a thing.. <br/>
Electrification <br/>
Electric kickboard, engine bicycles.. key crucial things <br/>

**Basic model of Mobility Service** <br/>
Key elements of Mobility Service <br/>
=> User, Service Provider, Service Integration <br/>
Need them for integration <br/>
-User can be independent <br/>
User get to Service integration, so are in ain intertwined relationship <br/>


**Basic Structure** <br/>
-Micrombility(Small/Sharing/Driver) < Vehicle < Non-Device(Platform Integration) <br/>
Offer service for person or human! <br/>
-MaaS Structure Example: Micromobility <br/>
ex. DOwnload => Scan on Qr code => User identification => Get to destination QR code again => NOtification arrive => Payment => Service done <br/>
-External Id/Server: login service<br/>
-MaaS Structure Example: Vehicle <br/>
Install app -> Car open up and ride -> Sit there wait until the vehicle destination you pointing out -> Payment automatically done <br/>
Serivice Provider: Have lots to do <br/>
Recent vehicle, key feature charger part of functionality... one shot service <br/>
-MaaS Structure Example <br/>
Get there -> Park => Service provider make sure car is there => <br/>
Get both info, charging things.. seamless offer services <br/>

**Details from the Basic structure** <br/>
All managed under document... <br/>
All these structures managed and specified <br/>
