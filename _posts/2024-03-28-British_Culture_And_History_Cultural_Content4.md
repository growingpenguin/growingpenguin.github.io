The rise or climb of to a higher rank or position <br/>
Rise or climb of the Black leader to a higher rank or position, specifically becoming the First Minister of Wales <br/
**milestone** <br/>
A significant event, achievement, or marker in history <br/>
It is used to denote the importance of having a Black leader become the First Minister of Wales for the first time <br/>
**grappling** <br/>
Struggling or dealing with something challenging <br/>
When it's said that a country is "grappling with racism," it means the country is actively trying to confront and address the issues and challenges related to racism <br/>
**striking** <br/>
noticeable, remarkable, or drawing attention <br/>
A "striking moment" refers to an event or occurrence that is significant enough to stand out and capture attention, often because it contrasts with what is typical or expected <br/>
**legacy**: <br/>
Something inherited from the past, such as traditions, problems, or historical actions, that continues to affect the present <br/>
The "legacy of empire" alludes to the long-lasting effects of colonialism and imperialism, including social, economic, and political issues, that former colonial powers and their former colonies are still dealing with today <br/> 
This can include racism, economic disparities, and cultural conflicts stemming from the history of empire and colonial rule <br/>
**heritage** <br/>
The background, culture, ancestry, or lineage that an individual has inherited from their forebears <br/>
When it is said that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak "has Indian heritage," it means that his familial or ancestral roots trace back to India <br/>
**semiautonomous** <br/>
A form of government or administrative structure that possesses a degree of self-governance or independence within a larger political or administrative framework <br/>
It suggests that the government in question, led by Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, operates with certain powers and authorities to manage its own affairs and make decisions on a range of issues, but under the broader sovereignty and legal framework of a larger entity, in this case, the United Kingdom <br/>
**marked a moment** <br/>
To symbolize or signify a significant point in time or event <br/>
A notable or historic occasion that is recognized as important or meaningful in the broader narrative or journey of a group, in this case, the nation <br/>
Vaughan Gething's election as the first Black leader of the governing Welsh Labor Party is seen as a pivotal event that signifies a change or progression in the collective history of Wales <br/>
**Cabinet** <br/>
A group of the most senior appointed officials of the executive branch in a government, typically composed of the top leaders who head major government departments and agencies <br/>
These officials are usually referred to as "ministers" in many parliamentary systems, such as that of the United Kingdom <br/>
The Cabinet is responsible for making high-level policy decisions and advising the head of government (such as a prime minister) <br/>
**Center-right**: <br/>
A political ideology or position that is right of the political center but not far-right <br/>
Center-right parties typically advocate for free market policies, limited government intervention in the economy, traditional values to some extent, and a certain degree of openness to social change, albeit more cautiously than their left-wing counterparts <br/>
In this context, the "center-right party" is a political party that aligns with these ideologies <br/>
The reference indicates that this party, traditionally seen as less progressive in terms of diversity and representation, has been actively working to broaden its appeal and include more diverse candidates within its ranks <br/>
