It is used to denote the importance of having a Black leader become the First Minister of Wales for the first time <br/>
**grappling** <br/>
Struggling or dealing with something challenging <br/>
When it's said that a country is "grappling with racism," it means the country is actively trying to confront and address the issues and challenges related to racism <br/>
**striking** <br/>
noticeable, remarkable, or drawing attention <br/>
A "striking moment" refers to an event or occurrence that is significant enough to stand out and capture attention, often because it contrasts with what is typical or expected <br/>
**legacy**: <br/>
Something inherited from the past, such as traditions, problems, or historical actions, that continues to affect the present <br/>
The "legacy of empire" alludes to the long-lasting effects of colonialism and imperialism, including social, economic, and political issues, that former colonial powers and their former colonies are still dealing with today <br/> 
This can include racism, economic disparities, and cultural conflicts stemming from the history of empire and colonial rule <br/>
**heritage** <br/>
The background, culture, ancestry, or lineage that an individual has inherited from their forebears <br/>
When it is said that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak "has Indian heritage," it means that his familial or ancestral roots trace back to India <br/>
**semiautonomous** <br/>
A form of government or administrative structure that possesses a degree of self-governance or independence within a larger political or administrative framework <br/>
It suggests that the government in question, led by Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, operates with certain powers and authorities to manage its own affairs and make decisions on a range of issues, but under the broader sovereignty and legal framework of a larger entity, in this case, the United Kingdom <br/>
**marked a moment** <br/>
To symbolize or signify a significant point in time or event <br/>
A notable or historic occasion that is recognized as important or meaningful in the broader narrative or journey of a group, in this case, the nation <br/>
Vaughan Gething's election as the first Black leader of the governing Welsh Labor Party is seen as a pivotal event that signifies a change or progression in the collective history of Wales <br/>
**Cabinet** <br/>
A group of the most senior appointed officials of the executive branch in a government, typically composed of the top leaders who head major government departments and agencies <br/>
These officials are usually referred to as "ministers" in many parliamentary systems, such as that of the United Kingdom <br/>
The Cabinet is responsible for making high-level policy decisions and advising the head of government (such as a prime minister) <br/>
**Center-right**: <br/>
A political ideology or position that is right of the political center but not far-right <br/>
Center-right parties typically advocate for free market policies, limited government intervention in the economy, traditional values to some extent, and a certain degree of openness to social change, albeit more cautiously than their left-wing counterparts <br/>
In this context, the "center-right party" is a political party that aligns with these ideologies <br/>
The reference indicates that this party, traditionally seen as less progressive in terms of diversity and representation, has been actively working to broaden its appeal and include more diverse candidates within its ranks <br/>
**Parliament**: <br/>
A legislative body of government that has the authority to make laws, debate national issues, and scrutinize the work of the government <br/>
In countries with a parliamentary system, it is a central institution of democracy and governance <br/>
Members of Parliament(MPs) are elected to represent the public and make decisions on national policy and issuese <br/>
The term "run for Parliament" means to campaign as a candidate in an election for a seat in this legislative body <br/>
The goal is to be elected as an MP and have the opportunity to influence national legislation and policy <br/>
**Pale**: <br/>
Racial homogeneity of the group, implying it is predominantly white and lacks ethnic or racial diversity <br/>
**Male**: <br/>
Gender imbalance, indicating that the group is overwhelmingly male and lacks significant female representation or leadership <br/>
**Stale**: <br/>
The group's ideas, policies, or attitudes are outdated, lacking innovation or adaptation to current social, cultural, or economic climates <br/>
**Ethnic diversity**: <br/>
Inclusion of people from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds within a certain context, such as an organization, government, or society as a whole <br/>
Ethnic diversity is often highlighted as a positive attribute that contributes to the richness of cultural experiences, perspectives, and ideas <br/>
In this statement, "ethnic diversity right at the top" likely refers to the highest levels of leadership or decision-making in a country, organization, or sector, indicating that individuals from a range of ethnic backgrounds are represented in these influential positions <br/>
**New normal**: <br/>
A state or condition that, after initially being considered unusual or atypical, has become standard, usual, or expected <br/>
When Sunder Katwala says that "ethnic diversity right at the top has become the ‘new normal,’” he is indicating that the presence of ethnic diversity among the highest ranks of leadership is no longer an exception or a rare occurrence <br/>
Instead, it has become an expected and standard feature of leadership structures, reflecting a significant shift in societal norms and expectations regarding representation and inclusion <br/>
**High office** <br/>
Positions of significant authority and responsibility within the government or other powerful institutions <br/>
These are leadership roles that have substantial influence over public policy, decision-making, and the direction of the country or organization <br/>
Examples of high office positions include presidents, prime ministers, cabinet members, judges in high courts, and other top-ranking officials <br/>
The mention of "diversity in high office" suggests an emphasis on having a varied representation of individuals from different racial, ethnic, gender, and socio-economic backgrounds in these influential positions <br/>
**inequality** <br/>
Disparities or unequal conditions in society that affect individuals' opportunities, access to resources, treatment, and quality of life based on various factors like income, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and other attributes <br/>
Social inequalities can manifest in various sectors, including education, healthcare, employment, and justice, leading to significant differences in how individuals experience and navigate their lives <br/>
**politicizing** <br/>
To politicize something means to turn an issue, topic, or situation into a subject of political debate, often with the intention of gaining advantage or support in a political context <br/>
It involves framing non-political issues in a way that aligns them with the agendas or ideologies of political parties or movements <br/>
When it's said that someone is "deliberately politicizing race," it means that race and racial issues are being intentionally used or highlighted in political discussions or campaigns, not necessarily to address the issues themselves in a constructive manner, but to influence public opinion, garner political support, or achieve specific political goals <br/>
**Wedge issue** <br/>
A wedge issue is a controversial or divisive topic used by political parties or figures to split apart or create tension within opposing groups, or to rally support within their own base <br/>
These issues are called "wedge" because they can be driven like a wedge between groups, often exacerbating divisions and distracting from other matters <br/>
Wedge issues are typically highly emotional or morally charged and can influence voters to support one party over another, even if their overall political views might not align perfectly with that party's platform <br/>
