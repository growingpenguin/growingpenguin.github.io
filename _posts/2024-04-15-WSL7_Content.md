## Professor Notes
Paragraph1 <br/>
Some newspapers conservative, Others are liberal <br/>
Fox News, more like a propagenda, can make it look like news <br/>
Money can be made made by skewing more to the conservative <br/>
Includes ommiting a few things <br/>
Paragraph2 <br/>
US, freedom of speech is guaranteed <br/>
Pretty hard to prove lying to do this <br/>
Have lots of liberal rights <br/>
Paragraph3 <br/>
Should just journalists always be impartial and open for audiences to decide <br/>
How about certain viewpoints should be promoted or sustained <br/>
Clear majority said range different people 
Many people disliked news outlets to take a certain point <br/>
Paragraph3 <br/>
Majority of all age groups wanted impartiality <br/>
Some younger people: Sometimes we want news outlets to advocate or give credibility to a certain viewpoint <br/>
Example: Vaccines <br/>
Qualitive interviews, and most of them said I don't need anyone else to say what to do <br/>
Most said they don't like journalists <br/>
 <br/>
How can we have a different viewpoint about a tornado <br/>
Better than conspiracy theories <br/>
Watching this online, opinions become infused into the news <br/>
Most people interviewed, most said they don't like the blend, opinion in one side and information in the other <br/>
Social and political news, equal sides to one sides? <br/>
Opinions, should be based on facts <br/>
Fasle equivalence <br/>
Environmental issues not caused by human? Avoid all the evidences <br/>
<br/>
Only minority believe that <br/> 
Most people  <br/>
DIninformation and propogenda is harmful <br/>
<br/>
Donald Trump, insurrection against country <br/>
Issues of vaccinations, people make exception, not everything should be presented in a balanced approach, to false equivalence <br/>
<br/>
Older people tend to think they are wise <br/>
They think, I don't care people make arguments, I will figure myself out <br/>
SOme people can be sleek to bad arguments <br/>
Germany, open to range of view points, even more than other countries <br/>
More liberal and younger people tend to think more than conservative people <br/>
18-24, fair number of people, we don't have to be neutral in every single issue <br/>
Old people maybe think they've figured out, I don't have to think about anything <br/>
 <br/>
 Younger people tend to be idealistic, see authentity <br/>
 Right wing, facisim, think this is dangerous <br/>
 In UK and Brazil, racism and domestic violence, no neutral, extreme issues <br/>
Germany, due to its history, say, because Germany is Democratic, we want to hear about range of issues, but unconstitutional, no limits <br/>
Germany has limits in speech to its history, speaking with holding a flag <br/>
German 30 year old man, constitution not holding the law, holocaust, not holding the law <br/>
As long as its not holocaust denial, ok, if its illegal like that, not ok <br/>

## Youtube video : How to control what people do| Propaganda 
Edward Bernays <br/>
Persuaded women to that Edward would smoke <br/>
One thing he did was, persuaded women to smoke more ciagrattes, bacon and eggs as healthy breakfast, overthrow democratic government <br/>
=> Propaganda can achieve many things <br/>
Bernays wrote a book called Propaganda <br/>
Half truth, bias, and many things <br/>
Propoganda can be sometimes good <br/>
Convince to get more vaccines, (trying to protect health) <br/>
Edward Bernays, going back 100 years ago, Bernays, <br/>
Brining democracy to europe <br/>
Came up with the term public relations <br/>
Word propoganda, people were uncomfortable to ww1, so he replaced it to public relations, which is almost the same thing <br/>
List of Clients <br/>
Some of the groups that propaganda worked for <br/>
First three companies are media <br/>
Back then, in the US, women smoking was a taboo <br/>
Tobaco companies, losing potential of money <br/>
Got involved in psychology, contacted psychologists, why women not smoking <br/>
Women's movements in the US around 1990, women got the right to vote <br/>
Tried to smoke using the iconic of torches of freedom <br/>
Smoking, feminist statist <br/>
Bunch of women and parade, and contacted media to set up the whole situation, Lit up cigarettes at the same time, and media covered <br/>
Looked at group psychology <br/>
If you can influence the leader of the group, then the whole group woule be influenced by the leader <br/>
If leader say it's a good idea, people will think it will be a good idea <br/>
Example: Bacon and eggs <br/>
Before Berneys <br/>
Infactual information, like eat more eggs, bacon and eggs are cheap and healthy (information) <br/>
Doctors, influence eating habits <br/>
Suggest that stating doctors saying bacons and eggs health <br/>
Doctor symbolize a long life and healthy <br/>
Asked indirect question, have a hardy breakfast, or something skimpy breakfast? <br/>
Nine out of ten doctors recommend a hearty breakfast like this one <br/>
Example: Sell piano <br/>
old: Buy piano now <br/>
New: Need something like this.. make it seem its your idea wanting the piano <br/>
