# R-CNN
## Goal
Object Detection: <br/>
Given an input image, job is to implement a model that has to output what's the object inside the image <br/>
Also predict a bounding box coordinate <br/>
-How to implement bounding box? <br/>
Sorting their top left coordinates x and y, their corresponding widths and heights <br/>
How can implement model? <br/>
Object Localization: <br/>
Classify and detect only one object in the image <br/>
(1)Receive an input image <br/>
(2)Reshape the image to a square with the size of 3X224X224 <br/>
(3)Pass it to through a couple of conv and pooling layers <br/>
-Capture all the necessary features existing in the image <br/>
-Result is 4X32X32 <br/>
(4)Flatten all the tensors <br/>
-Can flatten the tensors or use global average pooling  <br/>
-Have a vector describing all the features extracted from previous layers <br/>
-Result is 4096X1 <br/>
**Classification Branch** <br/>
(5)Fully connected layer1(Classifer) & Class scores <br/>
-Use a fully connected classifier at the end <br/>
-Result is 4096X1 to 1000X1 <br/>
-Give us class scores for every possible object you might expect <br/>
-Class scores example <br/>
Car:0.90, Bike:0.01, Motorcycle:0.03, <br/>
It has a car and its probability is 90% that there is a car in the picture <br/>
(6)Cross-Entrophy Loss & Correct label:Car <br/>
-It is a supervised learning task so we utilize the correct label and compute its loss function  <br/>
**Object Detection Branch** <br/>
(5)'Fully connected layer2 & Class scores <br/>
-Use another fully connected layer to output our bounding box coordinates <br/>
-Result is 4096X1 to 4X1 <br/>
-Looks like (x, y, w, h) <br/>
(6)'Box Coordinates & L2 loss <br/>
-Already know the correct bounding box during training and we use L2 loss as a loss function <br/>
Footnote: <br/>
Step1 ~ Step7 is an object classification task <br/>
(7)Weighted Sum <br/>
Use Weighted sum to compute the final loss <br/>
-One major disadvantage:  <br/>
Can detect only one object in the picture, because we output just one bounding box coordinate <br/>
So actually can't use in scenarios when there are multiple objects such as cars in our input <br/>
**Earliest Approach** <br/>
Have a picture, and a sliding window <br/>
![R-CNN1](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/bdc396dc-0920-4e29-a2f9-d9264ffbd1b6) <br/>
(1)Put the sliding window at the top left corner, and tell it classify the region <br/>
![R-CNN2](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/13144070-6daf-48a0-9608-1ac4f2c05143) <br/>
(2)Extract the region as an image <br/>
(3)Pass it to a neural network classifier <br/>
-Neural network classifier is an existing CNN module <br/>
(4)Produces c+1 output <br/>
-c: Expected classes we already know <br/>
-+1: Background, because the specific region might not have an object in there and in such cases, we want to classify it as a background <br/>
ex. sky without anything <br/>
(5)Slide our sliding window to every possible locations  <br/>
![R-CNN3](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/16233470-eefa-468d-92c4-b9de86c7b390) <br/>
-ex. Extract the region and classifies that there is a mountain in it <br/>
Repeat the process (Slide -> Extract -> Classification) <br/>
Possible Problem: <br/>
