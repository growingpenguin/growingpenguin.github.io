# Trie DataStructure
Trie: A datastructure that is made to search for strings swiftly.
Trie Main Theory <br/>
: Produce words in the form of a dictionary and use the tree's Parent & child node relationship for searching <br/>
Features of Trie <br/>
N dimension Trie : Determine N depending on the type of alphabet. <br/>
ex. <br/>
Alphabet is composed of 26 letters. Therefore this is a 26 dimension tree. <br/>
ex. The following are the figure of inputting the english words 'apple, air, apply'.<br/>

Process <br/>
1. The root node remains a vacant state. <br/>
2.  Produce a node that corresponds to each alphabet. <br/>
3. Input the word 'air' <br/>
4. While the 'a' node is not in a vacant state, the node 'i' and 'r' are vacant, so it new nodes are produced.<br/>
5. Input the word 'apply' <br/>
6. The similar process is repeated. If the searching node is vacant, produce new nodes. <br/> 
If not, implement the data structure 'Trie' <br/>
