## Overview of the process
![IAM9](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/123b16b9-43fd-45c4-adb1-586969ef8e12) <br/> 
User successfully created <br/>
![IAM10](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/e6d69de2-3f03-4b4e-896f-c0fbe264fd01) <br/>
By clicking on '사용자 그룹', we can identify the MLPrediction group successfully generated <br/>
![IAM11](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/7fd8c5ba-8e6f-48cd-b2ad-83e54498ee0c) <br/>
Observe the MLPrediction group, we can easily identify the user MyUser <br/>
![IAM12](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/34f5de8a-f558-4692-a384-d2a0960ba99d) <br/>
Identify permissions(권한) for the group MLPrediction <br/>
Can see the Administrator access attached to the MLPrediction group <br/>
![IAM13](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/5137b7e5-4aab-40d7-a3aa-bf86616d951f) <br/>
Identify permissions(권한) for the user MyUser <br/>
But when seeing the 연결 방식, it is stated '그룹 MLPrediction', meaning the permission was not assigned directly, but inherited from the group MLPrediction <br/>
## Create Access Keys
To access AWS Services, in VS Code exe, I will create access keys for the user MyUser <br/>
![IAM14](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/06210b02-b42d-4c3c-88c6-36c3a887e471) <br/>
Click on Access Key 만들기 <br/>
![IAM15](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/d97682b8-cb95-42aa-8165-6e96d0bc49f9) <br/>
Using access keys in a Visual Studio executable to log in and access AWS Lambda and S3 within your workflow – I would likely be working with local code <br/>
The option that mentions "로컬 코드" (local code) and provides for accessing the AWS account using application code in a local development environment is the one that seems most aligned with my needs <br/>
This choice allows me to integrate AWS services directly into your Visual Studio application, providing the necessary credentials to access AWS Lambda and S3 resources as part of your local development and testing process <br/>
Choose the option '로컬코드' > Click on '다음' <br/>
![IAM16](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/c0c7f9b6-4487-4537-be87-57c7881bd3ec) <br/>

Stored the Access key by clicking on '.csv 파일 다운로드' > 완료 <br/>
## Renew IAM credentials in my visual studio exe code

## Create New role for the Lambda function csv_sloshingprediction1
I want to create a role that grants the lambda function to access the S3 bucket which has the csv file I want to make inference on, and basically to process the parameters in csv_sloshingprediction1 <br/>
I aim to establish a role that authorizes the Lambda function csv_sloshingprediction1 to access the S3 bucket containing the CSV file needed for inference <br/>
This role will enable the function to process the parameters required for sloshing prediction within csv_sloshingprediction1 <br/>
Click on the IAM roles sections <br/>
![S3_19](https://github.com/growingpenguin/growingpenguin.github.io/assets/110277903/91591028-36c0-494d-a109-899433cf5b9e) <br/>
Click on AWS 서비스 for the category choose the entity that you trust most <br/>
Because this option is designed to grant permissions to an AWS service, like Lambda, to interact with other AWS services <br/>
Chose AWS Lambda for 사용 사례, because I am setting up a role for an AWS Lambda function <br/>
