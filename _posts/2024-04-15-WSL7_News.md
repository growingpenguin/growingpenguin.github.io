# Want an elephant? Botswana’s president says his country has too many.
## Words
**float**: <br/>
Propose or suggest an idea in a tentative or unofficial manner <br/>
It's often used to describe how ideas are introduced to see how they will be received before any formal decision is made <br/>
**trophy** <br/>
Something that is taken as a prize for success in hunting and fishing <br/>
Here, it specifically refers to parts of animals (like tusks, horns, or even whole animal bodies) that are kept as a symbol of success in hunting <br/>
The mention of banning the import of trophies from endangered species suggests that Germany is considering a prohibition on importing these items to protect such species <br/>
**rhetorical** <br/>
Was not meant to be taken literally or seriously, but rather was used for effect or to make a point <br/>
Essentially, he used the idea of filling London’s Hyde Park with 10,000 elephants as a rhetorical device to emphasize a point or provoke thought, rather than proposing a practical plan of action <br/>
It highlights the use of exaggerated statements in rhetoric to convey or underline a message, without the intent of actual implementation <br/>
**sharp-tongued** <br/>
Someone who speaks in a direct, somewhat cutting or critical manner <br/>
It implies that the speaker is using biting or somewhat harsh language, possibly to make a strong or impactful point <br/>
In this case, the president’s remarks are described as "sharp-tongued" to indicate that they are outspoken or critical <br/>
**lucrative**: <br/>
Something that is very profitable or has the potential to generate a significant amount of money <br/>
Here, the "lucrative business of big-game hunting" refers to the economic benefits derived from hunting large animals, which can be substantial, especially in terms of revenue from tourists and hunters who pay high fees for hunting permits <br/>
**impoverished**: <br/>
Being poor or in a state of poverty <br/>
When referring to "impoverished countries," it indicates nations with limited economic resources and low standards of living <br/>
In your example, it underscores the contrast between the economic benefits that big-game hunting can bring to a country like Botswana and the general economic challenges or poverty that the country may face.
**convention**: <br/>
Agreement or treaty between countries <br/>
In your context, the "Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora" (CITES) is an international agreement among governments aimed at ensuring that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival <br/> 
As a convention, CITES provides a framework that each participating country agrees to implement through its own laws <br/>
**permit system**: <br/>
A regulatory framework that requires permits to be obtained for specific activities <br/>
In this case, the trade and transportation of trophies derived from big-game hunting <br/>
Under CITES, this permit system controls and monitors the import, export, and re-export of species listed on its appendices, ensuring that such activities are sustainable and legal <br/>
Each permit issued is a document that must be presented and approved before certain wildlife products can cross international borders. This system is intended to prevent over-exploitation of endangered species through controlled trade <br/>
**preliminary** <br/>
Information or data that is initial or not yet final<br/> It suggests that the numbers or results are tentative and may be subject to change as more data is collected or further analysis is conducted. Essentially, the "preliminary numbers" from Germany's Federal Agency for Nature Conservation are early estimates or figures regarding the import of African elephant trophies, which could be updated or revised as more complete information becomes available<br/>
