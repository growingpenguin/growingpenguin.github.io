# Want an elephant? Botswana’s president says his country has too many.
## Words
**float**: <br/>
Propose or suggest an idea in a tentative or unofficial manner <br/>
It's often used to describe how ideas are introduced to see how they will be received before any formal decision is made <br/>
**trophy** <br/>
Something that is taken as a prize for success in hunting and fishing <br/>
Here, it specifically refers to parts of animals (like tusks, horns, or even whole animal bodies) that are kept as a symbol of success in hunting <br/>
The mention of banning the import of trophies from endangered species suggests that Germany is considering a prohibition on importing these items to protect such species <br/>
**rhetorical** <br/>
Was not meant to be taken literally or seriously, but rather was used for effect or to make a point <br/>
Essentially, he used the idea of filling London’s Hyde Park with 10,000 elephants as a rhetorical device to emphasize a point or provoke thought, rather than proposing a practical plan of action <br/>
It highlights the use of exaggerated statements in rhetoric to convey or underline a message, without the intent of actual implementation <br/>
**sharp-tongued** <br/>
Someone who speaks in a direct, somewhat cutting or critical manner <br/>
It implies that the speaker is using biting or somewhat harsh language, possibly to make a strong or impactful point <br/>
In this case, the president’s remarks are described as "sharp-tongued" to indicate that they are outspoken or critical <br/>
