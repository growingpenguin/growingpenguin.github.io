# Declaration of Independence 
**Paragraph1** <br/>
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br/>
: When it is necessary for a group of people to break away from the government they are under and become independent, they should explain why they are doing this to the other people in the world. <br/>
<br/>
**Paragraph2-1** <br/>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. <br/>
: We believe that all people are created equal and have certain rights that cannot be taken away, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Governments are created to protect these rights, and they get their power from the people. If a government becomes destructive of these rights, the people have the right to change or abolish it and create a new government. <br/>
<br/>
**Paragraph2-2** <br/>
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br/>
The colonies have patiently endured the King of Great Britain's abuse of power, but now they are forced to change their government because he has repeatedly tried to establish a tyranny over them. To prove this, we will present the facts to the world. <br/>
**Paragraph2-3** <br/>
King George III has abused his power in many ways. He has refused to pass important laws, dissolved legislative bodies, and prevented people from becoming citizens. He has also made it difficult for courts to operate and created new offices to harass the people. He has kept a standing army in the colonies without their consent, and he has made the military independent of and superior to the civil power. He has also worked with others to subject the colonies to foreign jurisdiction and to deprive them of their rights. He has even waged war against the colonies and plundered their seas, ravaged their coasts, and burnt their towns. He has also transported foreign mercenaries to the colonies to help him carry out his tyranny. He has constrained American citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, and he has even excited domestic insurrections amongst the people. <br/>
**Paragraph3-1** <br/>
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br/>
:The colonists have repeatedly asked King George III to stop abusing his power, but he has only ignored them and continued to do the same things. A ruler who acts like a tyrant is unfit to rule a free people.<br/>
**Paragraph3-2** <br/>
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. <br/>
We have tried to warn our British brothers and sisters about their government's attempts to extend its power over us. We have reminded them of how we came to settle here in the colonies. We have appealed to their sense of justice and family ties, and we have begged them to stop these usurpations, which will inevitably disrupt our relationship. But they have refused to listen. Therefore, we must accept that we must separate from Great Britain, and we must consider them to be enemies in war and friends in peace. <br/>
**Paragraph3-3** <br/>
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.<br/>
:We, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, thereby declare that the United States are free and independent states, and that all political ties between them and Great Britain are dissolved. We have the full power to levy war, make peace, and trade with other countries. We pledge our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to support this declaration.
