OmniGraph is Omniverse’s visual programming framework. It provides a graph framework that can easily connect functions from multiple systems inside Omniverse. It is also a compute framework that allows for highly customized nodes so that users can integrate their own functionality into Omniverse and automatically harness the efficient computation backend.

Inside Omniverse Isaac Sim, OmniGraph is the main engine behind the Replicators, ROS and ROS2 bridges, access to many sensors, controllers, external input/output devices, UI, and much more. The purpose of this tutorial is giving you a fast introduction into the world of visual programming via OmniGraph. We highly recommend you to checkout the much more in-depth documentation on OmniGraph, for it is a key component in Omniverse Kit.
