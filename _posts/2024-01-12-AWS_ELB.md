# Elastic Load Balancing Overview
## What is Load Balancing?
Load Balancer: Server or set of servers behind the scenes that will forward traffic that is received to multiple servers(e.g. EC2 instances) downstream <br/>

Ex. Three EC2 instances exist > Fronted by an elastic load balancer -> Three users directly connecting to elastic load balancer <br/>
-Each user has its load being sent, be load balanced, and would be connected to one backend EC2 instance respectively <br/>
-More users = More the load is going to be balanced across EC2 instance <br/>
-Users do not know which backend instance they are connected to. <br/>
Just know they have to connect to your elastic load balancer which gives one end point of connectivity only <br/>
